MONTEVIDEO
</span></h2>

<p>
In my former book, <i>South American Travels</i>, I made a
statement relative to the pronunciation of the word
"Montevideo" as follows: "Many foreigners make the
mistake of pronouncing the name of the city with the
accent on its penultima 'e'. Each syllable should be pronounced
alike, with no distinction made as onto which
syllable the accent falls." I have since found out that I
was wrong, and am convinced so by my losing a ten-dollar
bet with a gentleman relative to the pronunciation of the
Uruguayan metropolis. Montevideo has its accent on the
penultima. The word is derived from the Latin "<i>Montem
video</i>" the final <i>m</i> in <i>montem</i> having been dropped
to facilitate pronunciation. Its site was first discovered
by Magellan in 1520, and as the 493 feet high dun-colored
<i>cerro</i>, which dominates the western side of the harbor
on whose shores the city is now built, appeared on the
occidental horizon, somebody at the bow of the ship yelled
out, "Montem video" ("I see a mountain"), which words
gave the city its present name. It can be safely assumed
that the man at the bow who uttered the Latin exclamation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2'>[2]</a></span>
was a priest or a friar because who amongst a crew of
sailors and adventurers would have a knowledge of Latin
unless it was a man who had taken Holy Orders? The
Spaniards and Portuguese in those days never embarked
on any expedition without taking some of these gentry
along.
</p>

<p>
Montevideo is sometimes called "Queen of La Plata"
on account of its cleanliness, haughty reserve, and aristocratic
appearance; more often has it been styled "Modern
Troy" due to decades of internecine strife, anarchy,
revolutions, and a Ten Years' War. Now that there has
been quietude for several years, with prospects of continued
peace, it is unfair to its inhabitants to liken it
to the prehistoric city at the southeastern end of the
Hellespont.
</p>

<p>
Several times during the years 1915 and 1916, I visited
Montevideo, having made occasional trips from Buenos
Aires, but an episode connected with my last advent on
Uruguayan shores will take an indefinitely long time to
erase it from my memory. It was like this:
</p>

<p>
On February 17, 1916, I had embarked on the Lamport
&amp; Holt steamship <i>Vestris</i> at La Plata for Montevideo to
bid farewell to friends returning to the United States. The
steamer was scheduled to sail from Montevideo at 2 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span>
the next day.
</p>

<p>
When that time came I was in the dining room, and was
so engrossed in a conversation that appealed to me that
I never heard the ringing of bells and the blowing of
whistles that denote that an ocean leviathan is about to
get under way. Suddenly an acquaintance, Mr. Lynn B.
Packer of Norwich, N. Y., ran into the dining room calling
out: "The ship is in motion, Stephens, we are in for it!"
We both ran up the stairs and onto the deck. True
enough, the <i>Vestris</i> was sailing but at a snail's pace, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3'>[3]</a></span>
the anchor was being pulled up. The lighter containing
the visitors had left and was now but a black speck behind
the breakwater. Not even a fishing boat was in sight.
We ran to the port side, and saw a few hundred feet away
a rowboat in which were two men pulling away. We
yelled to them and waved our handkerchiefs; they stopped.
We took off our coats and waved them also; they swung
their rowboat around and rowed back towards us. A
steward and a couple of sailors got a rope-ladder which
they hung over the railing of the deck, and down this
Packer and myself clambered, and jumped into the rowboat
which had now reached the sides of the <i>Vestris</i>.
The two men of the rowboat now pulled out to let the
ocean liner pass by, so as not to get caught in the vortex
of water caused by the propellers.
</p>

<p>
The sea was rough; a leaden sky cast a gloomy canopy
over the leaden water; to the left rose the dun-colored
cerro crowned by its prison and lighthouse. In the background
nearly two miles away, seemed to rise in tiers, the
somber buildings of drab Montevideo, the twin towers
of the cathedral, the Gothic steeple of a church, and a
large rectangular pile at the water's edge, which was
formerly the university, being silhouetted against the sky
line. Black hulls of ships, merchantmen, and freighters
flying the flags of most civilized nations, besides the
interned German ships of the Kosmos Line, dotted the
harbor and the open sea outside of the breakwater, but we
were at least half a mile from the nearest one of them.
</p>

<p>
We now began to size up the two boatmen. They were
a villainous looking pair. The one who acted as the boss
was an undersized man about thirty-five years old. He
wore a black moustache, and about two weeks stubble of
beard. His hair was unkempt, and white mucus had
collected at the corners of his mouth and eyes. He stunk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4'>[4]</a></span>
of garlic, and his clothes were dirty and greasy. His
companion was a tall and slender man, a few years his
junior. His appearance was likewise unkempt, although
his long face, covered with pimples, was clean shaven,
except for an occasional straggling whisker on his chin
which his razor had overlooked.
</p>

<p>
The boss boatman, knowing me to be a North American,
attempted to converse with me in English, but his knowledge
of that tongue was so execrable that he soon had
to desist; he knew but a few words of Spanish. By mixing
lingoes we made ourselves understood and he informed
me that he was a resident of Rio de Janeiro, of which city
he was a native, and that he was at present employed as a
doctor on a Brazilian passenger ship in Montevideo, and
that his regular trips were from Manaos on the Amazon
to Montevideo, touching at all the seaports; his comrade,
he informed me, was a Paulista and was the Marconi operator
on the same ship. Both had been making a visit
to the different ships now anchored in Montevideo harbor,
having had chats with the doctors and Marconi-men of
said ships, and were returning to their own vessel when
hailed by us.
</p>

<p>
This yarn I refused to believe, for no man that I had
ever seen had a more unmedical appearance than the boss
boatman; moreover instead of attempting to row us to the
docks, both men were rowing towards the Brazilian vessel,
which we were approaching, and which belied its title
of a passenger ship, having more the appearance of a
freighter. The sea, as I said, was rough, and I yelled to
the boatmen to swing around as I had no desire to be
carried into the South Atlantic in an open boat; my misgivings
were not so much on account of the elements, as
for the thought that I became obsessed with, namely that
these two vagabonds were trying to shanghai us, endeavoring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5'>[5]</a></span>
to get us aboard the Brazilian ship. Montevideo,
Valparaiso, and Callao are noted as tough ports, where
shanghaiing is rife, and many of these stories were brought
to my mind. To Packer, who lay reposing in the stern,
I told my doubts. He replied that he had been thinking
the same thing for some time. I told him the best thing
for us to do would be to ask for the oars so that we could
row back to shore ourselves; in case the boatmen refused,
to rush them, and lay them out. He said he was game for
a fight but refused to row, giving some excuse which I
interpreted in meaning that he was too lazy. I had
nothing but a pocket knife with me, and in case of a fight,
meant to plant the blade in some vulnerable spot in the
anatomy of the boss boatman, whom I took to be the boss
villain.
</p>

<p>
We had gradually been drifting out in the open sea,
and the waves were becoming rougher. These were also
unpleasant thoughts, especially since during the last few
minutes the Brazilians had developed a streak of laziness.
Packer gave me a wink which was the cue, and I asked for
the oars. Great was my astonishment and also relief of
mind, when instead of refusing my request which would
have brought on a sanguinary fight with possible loss of
life to one or more of us, the boss boatman handed me the
oars. The Paulista, ready for a siesta, even though the
sea was rough, dropped his oars beside his comrade, and
turned over on his side for a snooze. All alone, with no
help, I had to row the three occupants back, as each
refused to labor any more. It took me two hours, hard
pulling, before we again reached the dock at Montevideo.
Believing that the "doctor" stunt was a lie, and that both
were sailors from the Brazilian vessel, I offered the boatmen
a piece of change for their aid in bringing us to terra
firma, for unless they had taken us in their rowboat we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6'>[6]</a></span>
would by this time be well under way for Santos. The
boss boatman was indignant and informed me that I was
insulting him. I then handed out some silver to the
"Marconi" operator; he was on the point of accepting it,
but withdrew his hand at a growl of disapproval from the
"doctor."
</p>

<p>
"You had better have some refreshment," I said to
them, leading the way to a nearby bar. They followed
me and seating themselves at the same table with us,
ordered some raspberry soda. This was astonishment
No. 2, for I could hardly conceive such villainous-looking
rascals imbibing anything milder than one hundred proof
whiskey.
</p>

<p>
"See this ring," quoth the Fluminense, turning a finger
to me so that I could see within the gold setting, a black
stone in which was chiselled the image of a serpent: "It
denotes the cult of Æsculapius. Most Brazilian doctors
wear them. I have been on the same ship for three years.
Here is my card." The man pulled a book out of his
pocket similar to a lodge pass-book at home, and true
enough I saw that he was telling the truth, and that he
really was a bona fide physician.
</p>

<p>
We must have sat at the table for about fifteen minutes,
when the Marconi operator got into a row with the waiter,
whom he claimed overcharged him the day before on a
dish of ice cream. The waiter called the proprietor and a
big rumpus occurred. It wound up by the Paulista pulling
a fist full of nickle-in-the-slot machine slugs out of his
pocket and hurling them with great force into the face
of the outraged proprietor. Before he could recover his
astonishment, both Brazilians "beat it" in the direction
of the docks. Packer and I, anticipating trouble, also
"beat it," but up the hill. No man likes to chase another
up hill. In case any reader of this article should go to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7'>[7]</a></span>
Montevideo, and would like to know where this particular
café is, I wish to inform him that it is situated at the
southwest corner of the streets, Rampla and Alzaibar.
</p>

<p>
That same night as I was standing on the Plaza Matriz
in front of the Hotel Lanata, I was accosted by a very
clean-looking gentleman, immaculately dressed in black,
wearing spats, and carrying a small cane. I thought it was
a case of mistaken identity and was about to pass on, when
to my amazement I recognized the doctor. The transformation
was complete. He could now pass for a boulevardier
while before he had the air of a cutthroat. He
informed me that he had rowed back to his ship, changed
his attire, and had returned to shore by a motor boat.
</p>

<p>
The city of Montevideo has about four hundred thousand
inhabitants exclusive of suburbs, and stretches over
quite an area of land, due to the broad streets and lowness
of its houses. It is built around the harbor and also along
the Atlantic Ocean which is separated from the harbor
by a hill in the shape of a whaleback. At the western end
of the harbor is the cerro which marks the mouth of the
La Plata and which is the only hill worthy of the name
until that of Lambaré is reached one thousand miles up
the river, the landmark for Asuncion. The whaleback
is the business part of the city, although the shopping
district has now a tendency to spread more eastward.
The gradient to the top of the whaleback on which lies the
Calle Sarandi, one of the principal streets of the city, is
gentle, but yet I have several acquaintances who refused
to walk it, preferring to go from the docks to the Plaza
Matriz in a taxicab. One of these men is Mr. Oliver H.
Lane, formerly of Washington before that city was made
"dry," but who, because that calamity befell the National
Capital, moved to Boston. One day in December, 1915,
he, Packer, and I started from the docks uptown on foot.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8'>[8]</a></span>
After we had gone two blocks, Lane planted his back
against the wall of a building and said:
</p>

<p>
"What do you take me for? Do you think I want to
walk to Paraguay?"
</p>

<p>
As there were no taxicabs around, Packer and I were
obliged to walk about three-quarters of a mile to the Plaza
Matriz to get one to return for Lane, whom we found in
the same identical spot with his back still against the wall.
</p>

<p>
Montevideo ranks according to the tonnage of vessels
entering and clearing its harbor as the ninth port in the
world, surpassing all South American cities in this respect.
Until about fifty years ago, it was the metropolis of the
La Plata watershed. About that time Buenos Aires
passed it, and to-day the population of the Argentine
metropolis is four times larger. Montevideo has a fine
harbor; Buenos Aires has none. The Uruguayan back
country is richer than the country behind Buenos Aires.
Montevideo has a wonderful climate, cool, invigorating,
with a fresh breeze always blowing; Buenos Aires has a
humid, enervating, somewhat depressing climate. With
these natural superiorities, one would think Montevideo
would outrank Buenos Aires but not so. Buenos Aires
has always had a spirit of progression, which has become
contagious and has spread to Rosario, and to Bahia
Blanca; Montevideo has always been conservative,
entirely wrapped in herself, indifferent to other cities.
Uruguay, which is the smallest republic in South America,
has an area of only 72,210 square miles, not as large as the
province of Buenos Aires alone. Of its population of
1,042,668 inhabitants, one half live within a radius of
twenty miles from the center of the city of Montevideo.
The difference between Buenos Aires and Montevideo is
so great that it is difficult to realize that they are separated
only by a night's run of 190 knots.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9'>[9]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The topography of the city is a succession of low hills
which flank the harbor. They continue to the cerro,
seven miles around the semi-circular harbor, and on their
sides and summits are built a succession of villages not
included in the incorporation limits of Montevideo. On
the cerro rise the whitewashed houses of the town of Villa
del Cerro, while at its bottom slopes near the La Plata
mouth there is a large eucalyptus grove of dark green
color, a landmark for many miles at sea.
</p>

<p>
There was but little building done in Montevideo
between the years 1912 and 1916; in fact I could see no
change, although I have no doubt but that the population
is increasing on a normal scale. The monotony of the
appearance of the residential streets is impressing. Each
street has the same cobblestone pavement; on each street
there are sycamore trees between the pavement and the
sidewalk; the houses are mostly the same, one and two
stories high, built of the same material and offering
absolutely no contrast in architecture, in size, or color
to the thousands like them in the Uruguayan metropolis.
This same condition must have existed since the Colonial
times, because one writer, whose book written about 1830
I recently read, said in his description of Montevideo that
on account of the great similarity of the houses and
absence of street numbers, drunken men frequently
mistook houses of other people for their own and entered
them at different times of the day and night causing much
embarrassment and confusion.
</p>

<p>
The residences of the wealthier inhabitants do not
have this monotonous uniformity. They are villas, set
back from the street in large gardens and lawns, enclosed
by low brick walls. In architecture they are light and
resemble the houses of the aristocracy of Rio de Janeiro.
Compared with the palatial homes of the Buenos Aires
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10'>[10]</a></span>
millionaires they are inexpensive. The Avenida Agraciada
is the main residential street, but the Avenida Brazil in
the suburb of Pocitos has many fine homes, some of which
are the summer abodes of Argentinos who like to spend
the hottest months of the summer by the seashore. The
very finest mansion in the city is on the Plaza Zabala, the
loafers' park, in the business section on the whaleback,
and not far from the docks. It is owned by an Italian
who wished to have his residence near to his place of
business.
</p>

<p>
The main shopping streets are Sarandi and Rincon.
These are parallel and are but one block apart. The
Avenida 18 de Julio, like the Avenida de Mayo in Buenos
Aires, is the parade street. It is a beautiful broad avenue
about a mile and a half long, and runs eastward from the
Plaza Independencia. Seven blocks up it is interrupted
in its course by the Plaza Libertad, formerly named
Sagancha. It is one of the finest streets in South America.
Many of the streets have old Indian names peculiar to
the country such as Timbo, Yaro, Tacuarembo, Yaguaron,
Yí, Cuareim, Ibicui, Ituzaingo, Guarani, etc. It is pleasant
to see this change in street names after a sojourn in
Argentina where in each city the nomenclatures of the
streets never vary, with the omnipresent San Martin,
Tucumán, Córdoba, Corrientes, La Rioja, and many others.
</p>

<p>
Montevideo and its suburbs on the ocean are the great
bathing resorts of South America and are visited annually
by more people than Mar del Plata, the latter place being
exclusively for the rich. On account of its proximity to
Buenos Aires, it is resorted to daily by great numbers of
tourists, who make the night trip across the La Plata
River. Pocitos is the most popular bathing resort. The
poor natives do their swimming from the rocks on the
ocean front near the heart of the city. They are invariably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11'>[11]</a></span>
garbed <i>à la</i> Adam, and are visible by all the occupants
of the electric tramcars that pass along that shore. The
most aristocratic beach in Montevideo is the Playa Ramirez
but people do not flock to that section as much
for bathing as they do for gambling. Everything goes in
Montevideo. The exclusive and expensive Parque Hotel
at the Playa Ramirez, the show place of costly raiment,
and of sparkling gems which embellish the figures of their
wearers, has in connection the finest gambling house
in America, roulette and baccarat being the attractions.
The Parque Hotel, which was formerly under the management
of a naturalized United States citizen, Edward
Aveglio, is now under the same management as the Palace
Hotel in Buenos Aires, and is considered to be one of the
best seashore hotels in South America. It is patronized
largely by Argentine aristocracy.
</p>

<p>
The gambling establishment, probably after those of
Monte Carlo and San Sebastian the most luxurious edifice
of its kind in existence, opens at 5 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> and closes at 7.30
<span class='s08'>P.M.</span> It reopens at 9 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> and closes at 2 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span> A fee of
one peso ($1.04) is charged to enter. One peso is the
lowest permissible play on any single number at roulette
and one hundred pesos is the highest. Unlike the Argentine
roulette wheels which have a 0 and a 00, this one has
but a single zero which gives the player (or rather the
victim) one nineteenth of a better show to win, if
successful.
</p>

<p>
The same class of crowd that graces most European
casinos is seen here at its zenith. There is present the
nervous individual, who wants the public to think he has
a system. To make them believe it, he pretends to study
a chart and makes pencil notations. When he loses, he
mutters an unintelligible exclamation. There also grace
the scene fat dowagers with paste diamond necklaces.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12'>[12]</a></span>
Some women who have wasted their allowance on bridge
and poker, and are now in the clutches of the moneylender,
come here to attempt to retrieve their fortune on
one final coup, in most cases their swan song. Bankers,
diplomats, millionaires, and cabinet officers from Buenos
Aires, a president of one of the Latin republics are to be
seen. Young fops are in evidence, not to play, but to ogle
the raft of glorious girls always to be found in propinquity
to tables of chance.
</p>

<p>
The casino does a great bar business in champagne
cocktails to the tune of forty-one cents a glass. This
champagne cocktail, regardless of its high price, seems to
be one of the favorite strong drinks there. The soft drink
that tickles the palate of the Montevideanos is a nauseating
concoction named <i>palta</i>. It is made of orange juice,
pineapple juice, sugar, and the yolk of an egg; to it is
added siphon water. It is then stirred, and served in a
large goblet. I tried some of it as an experiment and am
sorry that I did not stick to beer, for the egg that the
mixologist used in my palta was rotten. In R. Bibondo's
Brazilian coffee house on Suipacha Street in Buenos
Aires, I once received a piece of cake in whose making a
rotten egg was likewise used.
</p>

<p>
Although the Grand Hotel Lanata cannot be called
first-class in any respect, excepting the restaurant which is
the best in the city, it is far better for the unaccompanied
male visitor to stop there than at the Parque, on account
of its central location. It takes twenty minutes by
electric car to reach the Parque from the Plaza Independencia.
It costs $1.20 to reach it by taxicab. The Grand
Hotel Lanata of Ximines and Santamarina is in the central
part of the city on the Plaza Constitucion (formerly called
the Plaza Matriz) and is convenient for shoppers and sightseers.
The Oriental near the docks is a good hotel, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13'>[13]</a></span>
the glass-roofed parlor and lobby is malodorous from poor
ventilation. Other good hotels are the Colon, Barcelona,
and Florida Palace. Regarding the last-mentioned place,
I must state that its proprietor is a Brazilian who does not
draw the color line as to his clientele.
</p>

<p>
Worthy of interest are the cathedral, the Solis theatre,
the central market, the colonnaded buildings on the Plaza
Independencia, the new university, the central cemetery,
and the Uruguaya brewery.
</p>

<p>
The cathedral is a twin-towered and domed majestic
structure on the Plaza Constitucion with an elaborately
decorated chapel. Four golden suns (the sun is the emblem
of Uruguay) are painted on an azure background
on the wall beneath the dome. The rays of the natural
sun above, penetrating the yellow and blue skylights of the
dome, cast weird and ghostly lights in the interior.
</p>

<p>
The Uruguaya brewery is on the Calle Yatai, to the
west of the center of the city, but nearly two miles from
the downtown business section. It is best reached by
electric tramcar. The reason for a visit to it is the large
beer hall like the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, and whose
replica is to be found nowhere else in the Western Hemisphere.
There are large bare tables, with chairs and
benches. The visitor sits at one of these. He need not
give an order for no sooner is he seated than a full schuper
of foaming elixir is placed in front of him. When he has
had enough, he turns his empty mug bottom up, otherwise
it is a sign that his thirst has not been quenched and
that he is in line for another one, which is immediately set
in front of him.
</p>

<p>
The specialties of Montevideo are the polished agates
and stones common to Uruguay. These are found in
abundance in the department of Minas, and although
expensive are fine souvenirs. No tourist should visit the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14'>[14]</a></span>
city without taking some away as they make admirable
gifts to friends at home. They are made into paper
weights, paper cutters, stamp holders, buttons, etc. The
best ones are dark blue; next come the smoky gray. Also
beautiful, but cheaper, are the brick red ones, and those
that are a combination of black and white.
</p>

<p>
A beautiful pink lily graces the lawns of the Avenida
Agraciada. In shape it is like our common orange red
milk lily but unlike the milk lily which grows in racemose
clusters on a single stalk this Uruguayan lily has but one
blossom. It is hardy and should thrive in the United
States.
</p>

<p>
A gastronomic delicacy of Montevideo is the lobster
which is caught on the Uruguayan littoral, and which is
seldom to be procured in Buenos Aires restaurants.
</p>

<p>
Montevideo vies with Rio de Janeiro as being one of
the cleanest cities in the Western Hemisphere; like Rio de
Janeiro, its taxicabs and public automobiles for hire are
the best in the Western Hemisphere. The Montevideano
drivers are reckless, and one day while out driving in the
suburbs in a hired motor car, the chauffeur tried to drive
his machine through a narrow place with the result that
he drove into a five-mule-power wagon and smashed the
left headlight and dented the hood for his pains. Returning
by the same road shortly afterwards, he met the same
wagon, and angered drove into the mules for revenge.
This caused much annoyance as the mule driver, not knowing
that the automobile was a public vehicle; believed that
it belonged to me and that I had set the chauffeur up to
this nefarious trick. The latter, being a cur, stood safely
to one side while I and the teamster had the altercation.
Although we nearly came to blows on account of the
chauffeur's scurvy stunt, the latter never opened his
mouth to help me out of the difficulty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15'>[15]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Uruguayan metropolis is the congregating place of
desperadoes, ruffians, and other gentry of similar character
from Argentina, and other nations. They loiter about
the entrances of the disreputable saloons and sailors'
dives and by their drunken actions and foul speech make
it impossible for a respectable woman to pass down any
of the streets near the docks without an escort. Argentina,
glad to be ridden of this class of social outcast, makes no
effort to extradite them unless they have committed some
major crime. Here in Montevideo, they "raise hell" and
scarcely a day goes by without the newspapers mentioning
some murder, assault, or burglary that has taken place.
</p>

<p>
One of these gentry, a Cockney, evidently mistaking me
for one of his kind, approached me one day as I sat in front
of a café under the colonnades in the Plaza Independencia,
and asked me for a job. He said:
</p>

<p>
"I ham not a bit particular what kind of a job it be,"
and drawing near to my ear, he let his voice drop as he
spoke: "I hax no questions. If there be hanybody you'd
like to put out of the way, Hi'm the man to do it."
</p>

<p>
Not many people traveling between Montevideo and
Buenos Aires ever think of making the trip otherwise than
on one of the palatial steamers of the Mihanovich Line
which ply between the two ports in a night's run. The
luxurious steamers <i>Ciudad de Buenos Aires</i> and the <i>Ciudad
de Montevideo</i>, and the smaller but admirable <i>Londres</i>
and <i>Lisboa</i>, are in the height of the season jammed with
passengers nearly to overcrowding. Tired of gazing upon
the sluggish and muddy La Plata River and eager to see
the Uruguayan landscape, I decided to make the trip by
rail as far as Colonia and thence make the twenty-five
mile crossing to Buenos Aires on one of the smaller boats.
</p>

<p>
Colonia, capital of the department of the same name, is
153 miles distant by rail from Montevideo. Trains run
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16'>[16]</a></span>
thrice a week only, on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,
making the return trip the next day, and their running
time is seven hours and fifteen minutes, the speed including
stops being slightly over twenty-one miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
I left Montevideo on the Central Railroad one morning
at 6.15 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span>, and thirty-five minutes later entered the
department of Canelones at the large village of Las Piedras.
The landscape during that short distance and even
as far as 25 de Agosto, where the department of San José is
entered was a monotonous succession of low rolling hills,
with low, long red brick and whitewashed <i>estancia</i> buildings
set back from the country roads, at the edge of eucalyptus
and pepperberry groves. Herds of fat cattle and
sheep browsed in the pastures tended by shepherd boys
with long-haired dogs. Between Las Piedras and 25 de
Agosto a small city was passed. Its name is Canelones
and was formerly called Guadelupe. It is the capital of
Canelones and lies to east of the railroad between it and
a river named the Canelon Chico. The rivers, Canelon
Grande and Canelon Chico give the name to the province.
</p>

<p>
25 de Agosto is nothing but a railroad junction with
some repair shops. The main line of the Central Railroad
runs north to the Brazilian frontier at Rivera, and is here
joined by the branch that goes westward to Colonia. The
department of San José which is now entered, presents
a different aspect than Canelones for the trees which had
hitherto been present in abundance around the estancias,
had now disappeared. The country had become more
rolling, and to the westward a low range of hills appeared
on the horizon. As far as the eye could see, a canopy of
yellow dried prairie grasses bedecked the parched and
blistered soil, sweltering beneath the scorching rays of the
hot February sun. All over this seething landscape,
roamed at will, half wild cattle, long and gaunt. It is as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17'>[17]</a></span>
much as a man's life is worth to venture on foot amidst a
herd of these Uruguayan cattle. They seldom attack a
horseman, knowing that he has them at an advantage, but
the foot traveler should be wary, for the quadrupeds
know the tables are turned, and will charge and gore him
to death on sight. Birds of the genus Struthio, spoken
of as ostriches, but which in reality belong to the branch
named cassowaries, as they have three toes instead of two
like the ostrich, and no tufted tail feathers like the latter,
mingle with these nomadic cattle; so does the timid deer,
unafraid and on terms of comradery, for it is only against
man that these beasts have animosity.
</p>

<p>
The city of San José, one of the largest in Uruguay,
whose population I imagine is about fifteen thousand
inhabitants, is reached at 9.11 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span> It is pleasantly situated
on a river of the same name at the base of some high
hills, which rise at the west of the city. The town itself
is intersected by the railroad which in a Uruguayan city is
unusual as most are generally at quite a distance therefrom.
At Mal Abrigo, which is reached about an hour
after leaving San José, the railroad branches out again,
the other one going to Mercedes, a pleasant city on the
Rio Negro, and the capital of the department of Soriano.
Continuing on the Colonia line, we enter the department
of Colonia and keep on till we reach a small place named
Rosario which is the junction for another branch line to
a La Plata port named Puerto del Sauce. Colonia is
reached at 1.30 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> Connection is made with small
boats of the Mihanovich Line which sail one hour later,
making the crossing to Buenos Aires in three hours to the
tune of $2.89.
</p>

<p>
Colonia is a fine little town with about eight thousand
inhabitants lying directly across the La Plata River from
Buenos Aires from which city I imagine it to be about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18'>[18]</a></span>
twenty-five miles distant. It is cool, with a fresh breeze
generally blowing and, owing to this, is much visited by
the inhabitants of the Argentine metropolis as a health and
summer resort. It has two good hotels, the Esperanza
and the Ruso. Besides the boats that ply daily between
Buenos Aires and Colonia, there are excursion steamers
Sundays; also those that make nightly trips returning at
an early hour of the morning. The reason for this last
mentioned service is that in Uruguay gambling is permitted,
and at San Carlos, near Colonia and reached by
a narrow gauge railway, is another casino where the click
of the ball as it revolves on the disk of the roulette wheel
disturbs the nocturnal air.
</p>

<p>
My friend Packer had an obsession for this kind of
pastime, and many were the nightly visits he made to
San Carlos. On one of these trips, while watching the
game in the casino, an Englishman had made a considerable
winning, but owing to his inability to converse in
the Spanish language, the croupiers were endeavoring to
cheat him out of his winnings. He appealed to Packer,
who helped him out and got his money for him. On the
trip back to Buenos Aires that same night, he and Packer
were seated opposite to one another in the dining-room.
Packer tried to enter into conversation with him. The
Englishman puckered up his lips and said: "I no speeka
Engleesh." He deserved to be thrashed. It is a very
common occurrence in most countries of South America,
especially in Argentina for Englishmen to try to hide their
nationality and pass off as a native. Why they do this
odious act, I do not know, but any foreigner no matter
how ignorant he is, can always spot an Englishman by his
mispronunciation of the language he is trying to hide
himself under.</p>

<h2>
CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="s08">BUENOS AIRES</span>
</h2>

<p>
Buenos Aires which should have been named Malos
Aires, on account of the enervating, depressing humidity
of its summer climate when the thermometer sometimes
registers as high as 104° Fahrenheit, and when not a
breath of air is stirring, is a city of nearly 1,750,000 inhabitants
and rivals Philadelphia towards being the third
in population in the New World. This capital of Argentina,
built upon the west bank of the muddy La Plata
River in latitude 34° south is the entrepôt and distributing
point for all merchandise and goods that enters and leaves
the vast territory which comprises the La Plata system
and in fact of all southern South America east of the
Andes. It is a city of marble statues, of elegant public
buildings, of sumptuous palaces, of parks and boulevards,
and is often spoken of as the "Athens of America." It is
also a city of narrow streets, of <i>conventillos</i> (poorer class
tenements) teeming with Hebraic and Sicilian life, of confidence
men, lottery ticket vendors, Greek and Syrian
peddlers, fugitives from North American justice, bewhiskered
Irish bums, and Galician Jews reeking of garlic,
adorned with corkscrew sideburns. Down its avenues
parade the same sort of crowd seen in Naples, also the
pompous banker, the bespatted fop with slender cane,
the staid business man, the artizan, beggars galore, and a
galaxy of prostitutes, both Iberian and <i>criolla</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22'>[22]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The most remarkable thing about Buenos Aires is how
fast one can get rid of one's money with so little received
for it in return. Everything costs half as much again as
what it should, with the possible exception of clothes and
shoes. Meals, hotel rooms, beverages, lingerie, photographic
material, drugs, theater admissions, and in fact
nearly everything under the sun is sky high. The entertainments
for a stranger to indulge in are but few and
mediocre. It is every day the same routine after the first
week of novelty of sight-seeing has worn off. Unless in
Buenos Aires on business, the stranger absolutely kills
time unprofitably by getting into a rut from which he does
not extricate himself until it is time for him to sail for
home. He finds himself two or three times a day at the
same table in front of the same café, watching the same
people promenade by, the only variation being an occasional
visit to a burlesque show, the race track, the post
office, or to the zoölogical garden.</p>

<p class='caption'>Congress Building, Buenos Aires
</p>

<p class='caption-sub'>
This is the finest building in South America. It cost $20,000,000. All the marble for its facing was imported from Italy</p>
</div>

<p>
In a previous book, I stated that the sycamore trees on
the Avenida de Mayo were sickly and did not think that
they would live. I first saw them in January, 1913. In
December, 1915, when I again beheld them, I was astonished
at their appearance. They were a third again as
large, and they begin to show prospects of becoming elegant
shade trees. The subway was completed in 1914.
It begins at the Plaza de Mayo, on which square the Casa
Rosada, or Capitol, faces, and continues underneath the
Avenida de Mayo to the mile-distant Congress Building,
thence underneath the next parallel street to the north,
Rivadavia, the bisecting thoroughfare of the city, to the
Once railroad station, the terminus of the Western Railway.
An extension runs three miles farther to a section of
the city named Caballito. Caballito is the name that
the Naón estancia went by years ago before the city grew
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23'>[23]</a></span>
up. The part of the city where the estancia once stood
still retains the name. Compared to subways in other
cities, this one of Buenos Aires is poorly patronized. It
resembles the Budapest subway, more than it does the
New York or Boston ones, and its cars make but little
better speed than do those in the Budapest tube. Cab
fare and taxicabs are cheap, which are undoubtedly
some of the primal causes of the subway's not excessive
patronage.
</p>

<p>
After his first few days in Buenos Aires, when the
novelty of a strange city had worn off, a friend and brother
Elk, Mr. Oliver H. Lane, remarked to me:
</p>

<p>
"Buenos Aires looks to me just like a big Italian city.
Her Avenida de Mayo, however, is a poor imitation of the
Parisian boulevards."
</p>

<p>
In the first respect, I agree with him. The architecture
of the buildings, the attire of the male inhabitants, the
way the moustaches are trimmed, the cafés, the <i>toscanos</i>,
the wax matches, the lottery tickets, the dirty paper money,
the confectionery stores, the ice creams, and the beggars
all savor of the Lavinian shores. In the second respect I
cannot agree with him. The Avenida de Mayo is physically
somewhat similar to the Parisian boulevards, but in
character it is widely different. If it is supposed to ape
them, it is then a poor imitation, but so different is it in
most respects, that as a first impression I would only call
it a physical imitation. The oftener and the longer one
sits in front of the cafés and watches the people pass by,
the further apart he draws the comparison of this street
to any street in the world. I would designate the Avenida
de Mayo as original. The buildings that flank it are much
taller than those of Paris; the street is also considerably
narrower than those in the French capital; the crowd that
parade the sidewalks is also not the same.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25'>[25]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="i050" id="i050"></a>
<img src="images/i-050.jpg" width="332" height="550" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Buenos Aires Types</p>
</div>

<p>
Rivadavia is the street which runs at right angles to the
La Plata River, and continuing westward into the country,
divides the city into two parts, its intersectors having
different nomenclatures south of it than they have north.
For instance, a cross street has the name Santiago del
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26'>[26]</a></span>
Estero south of it, and Talcahuano north of it: another is
named Piedras south of it, and Esmeralda north of it, etc.
In the old section of Buenos Aires, where the buildings are
almost entirely given up to wholesale and retail trade, the
streets are exceedingly narrow. A decade and a half ago,
in order to give the people a breathing space, and to relieve
the congestion of traffic in this part of the city, houses one
half a block south of Rivadavia were torn down, and the
Avenida 25 de Mayo was put through. It starts at the
Plaza de Mayo on which is the Capitol, and ends at
the Plaza Congreso, on which is the new white marble
Congress Building, the finest and most expensive building
in all South America. The length of this boulevard is
about one mile.
</p>

<p>
Architecturally the exterior and façades of the Buenos
Aires buildings are as fine as any in the world; the style
of architecture predominating is original, but the contagion
has spread, and the new structures of Montevideo,
Rosario, and Mar del Plata have copied the ornate and
domed style that is preëminently Bonaerense. In order
to compare the architecture of Buenos Aires to that of
another city, let us choose Paris or Vienna because the
Argentine capital is a city that is fundamentally European.
Although more beautiful in buildings than either Paris or
Vienna, it can hold no comparison to them in the massiveness
and solidity of the edifices in either of them. Nearly
all the buildings in Argentina are built of the poorest
imaginable brick, loosely fitted together, but little mortar
having been used. To these is given a coating of plaster,
which on the façades is worked into ornaments. On
account of the climatic effects on the cheap material,
these buildings in a few years' time take on a weather-beaten
appearance. On account of the poor foundations
on a muddy soil, many structures sink after a few years.

</p>

<p>
With the exception of the modern steel and trussed
concrete edifices, the old patriarchal houses of the colonial
times and days of the early republic are the best built.
Hundreds of these are to be seen to-day on the side streets.
They have marble-paved, glass-roofed patios onto which
open the doors of the parlor, dining room, and living rooms.
These rooms are likewise dependent on the patio for their
light. Behind the first patio is generally a second one, open
to the sky, but on rainy and on sunny days decked with an
awning. Here sit the family in their leisure hours; from
this patio open the doors to the bedrooms. A small garden
is invariably at the rear; the kitchen and servants'
quarters are in its proximity. The handsome villas and
private residences of the wealthy inhabitants differ but
little in architecture from the same class of buildings the
whole world over. It must not be imagined that because
the material and construction are poor that they are
cheap. They cost nearly double to build what their duplicates
would be in the United States. Brick, stone, iron,
sand, lime, and lumber are much more expensive than at
home.
</p>

<p>
The cost of living in Buenos Aires is higher than in New
York, with the exception of some articles I have already
named. The hotel rates are, however, cheaper. On the
Avenida de Mayo, Calle Florida, and Calle Callao, the
show streets, one is obliged to pay Fifth Avenue prices
for articles purchased; on the side streets the same goods
are much cheaper. The average native does not patronize
the show places. At any of the Avenida de Mayo
cafés, a small cordial glass of Benedictine costs twenty-one
cents. At one of the side-street <i>almazens</i> (grocery stores),
which have a dispensary, the same glass costs nine and one
half cents. A pint of Guinness' stout at the Hotel Savoy
costs sixty cents; at the Avenida de Mayo cafés it sells
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29'>[29]</a></span>
for forty-three cents, while in the almazens it can be bought
for twenty-six cents.</p>

<p>
Regarding hotels, Buenos Aires has some very fine ones.
Most have table d'hôte service, which in Argentina is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30'>[30]</a></span>
taken in preference to meals à la carte, for most of the
guests take their rooms <i>en pension</i> unless they intend to
make a short stay only.
</p>

<p>
The Plaza Hotel, which is the best known and widest advertised,
is operated by the Ritz-Carlton Company. It was
built by the banker Ernesto Tornquist and leased to them.
It is nine stories high, and cost nine million pesos ($3,843,000.00).
Its rates are excessive for the service rendered.
The rooms are small, its location is not central, and there is
nothing to it that gives it the tone of comfort to be had at
the other hotels, although the cuisine cannot be improved
upon. Imagine paying twenty-five dollars a day for a
small room with bath and vestibule, lunch and dinner, but
not including breakfast. The Plaza is in much demand for
private balls and teas, and is also much patronized by
North American commercial travelers who wish to make
a splurge, and impress their prospective customers with
their own importance, or with the importance of the firm
which they represent. An incident that happened in
connection with this hotel should be mentioned.</p>

When Naón, the Argentine ex-ambassador to the United
States, on a recent trip home wrote to his family asking
them to get suitable apartments for him, his sister had a
talk with the manager of the Plaza Hotel. The latter,
seeing a chance for a hold-up, told her that Naón could
have a certain apartment for five thousand pesos ($2135.00)
a month. This figures out $71.17 a day. Naón refused
to consider the matter and engaged a much better suite
at the Hotel Majestic at a much cheaper rate. A month
or so afterwards, while attending a reception at the Plaza
extended to him by the American Universities Club,
the manager servilely approached him, and asked him
where he was staying. Upon Naón answering that he
was stopping at the Majestic, the manager spoke deprecatorily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31'>[31]</a></span>
of the last-mentioned hostelry, and told him he
would do much better for him at a lesser price at the Plaza.
Naón said that he should have done so in the first place,
but on account of his trying to hold him up, he would not
stop at the Plaza if he should put the whole hotel at his
disposal free of charge.
</p>

<p>
The two best hotels in Buenos Aires, to my notion, are
the Majestic and the Grand.
</p>

<p>
The Majestic is on the Avenida de Mayo, at the northwest
corner of Calle Santiago del Estero, which is but two
blocks from the Plaza Congreso. It was opened in 1910
at the time of the Argentine Centennial. It was rented
that year by the government to house the foreign diplomats
attending the celebration. The prices are reasonable;
the rooms all have baths, and most of them are suites
with parlors. The meals are table d'hôte and the food
and service are excellent. The building is seven stories
high, has a roof garden, and a corner tower. The parlors
and writing room are on the third floor and are lighted
from a skylight at the top of the five-story courtyard of
pillared balconies. The Majestic is the residence of many
foreign ministers and their families; of people of wealth
and culture; and of the commercial representatives of the
best European firms. It is no show place, but a hotel of
quiet refinement.</p>

<p>
The Grand Hotel, good but expensive, is on the main
shopping street, the narrow Calle Florida, one block north
of the Avenida de Mayo in a very noisy part of the city.
The narrowness of the streets makes the rooms dark. The
Palace Hotel, a large establishment on the Calle 25 de
Mayo, is well spoken of. It overlooks the Paseo de Julio
and a beautiful park at the river's edge, but the class of
people and stores always to be found in the neighborhood
of the docks makes the location poor. Among the older of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33'>[33]</a></span>
the modern hotels which are also good are the Paris, with
a large restaurant and café, the Cecil, the Splendid, and
the Esclava. The España, patronized by Spaniards, is a
lively and excellent place with an à la carte dining room.
It is a good place for the single man to stop at; also the
Galileo and the Colon are first class, clean, and have
good restaurants. The Colon is owned by the Gontaretti
brothers, who are likewise proprietors of the Hotel Regina
at Mar del Plata. It has in connection the best confectionery
store in Buenos Aires, that of Dos Chinos.
</p>

<p>
Of all the Buenos Aires hotels, the biggest fake is the
Savoy, which is owned by the da Rossi Company. It is on
the southeast corner of the streets Callao and Cangallo,
but two blocks from the Plaza Congreso. It was opened
in 1913, at which time the current talk was that the district
in which it is situated was going to be the best in the city.
The prices are exorbitant, the food is poor, and the rooms
are dirty. As in all the large Buenos Aires hotels, the
prices here are made for the guest according to the financial
judgment the scrutinizing manager passes on him.
The waiters in the Savoy are veritable robbers, and there
are two prices for drinks, and for the use of the billiard
table, the North Americans having the benefit in being
obliged to pay the highest of the two prices. They tried
to "put one over" on "yours truly" on the price of wet
goods one day when the writer was playing pool with some
friends. The waiters had evidently forgotten that they
had sold me a couple of bottles of Guinness' stout the day
previous at a reduction of forty centavos (17 c.) a bottle
under the price they now anticipated that I would pay.
An argument followed in which I won out, but only after
I had threatened them with a cessation of visits in case
they insisted on making me pay the excess tax that they
had imposed upon me.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35'>[35]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Bonaerense restaurants are usually connected with
the hotels, although there are many that are not. Among
the best of the latter are the Rotisserie Sportsman, Charpentier's,
and the Petit Jardin. Aue's Keller, the Kaiserhalle
recently opened by the employees of Aue's Keller,
and the Bismarck are German restaurants and beer halls.
There are many Italian restaurants, that of Paccatini on
Calle Moreno a few doors east of Calle Piedras being quite
popular.</p>

<img src="images/i-060.jpg" width="543" height="315" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Zoölogical Garden, Buenos Aires</p>
</div>

<p>
The cafés are excelled by none in the world either in
size or in the expense of their equipment. Life in them
is not as animated as in those of Vienna, Budapest, or
Paris, and they close about 1.00 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span> They are not
patronized much by women, nor do they display moving
pictures on their walls as in Rosario. They are solely
rendezvous for people who enter them to talk or drink;
many have antiquated billiard tables. Among the best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36'>[36]</a></span>
are the cafés Paris, Colon, and Tortoni, all on the Avenida
de Mayo.
</p>

<p>
As the Argentinos are not as a rule solely addicted to
the frequent imbibing of strong drinks, soft drinks such as
<i>refrescos</i>, lemonade, beer, coffee, and tea play an important
rôle in the dispensing of liquid refreshment at cafés. The
average Argentino suffers from gastric, digestive, and
intestinal ailments, not so much from overeating alone
as from his utter inability to use discretion in drinking.
For breakfast he will have coffee; before lunch he will
drink a couple of vermouths with bitters, which he designates
as an appetizer. (His favorite bitter is a sickening,
sweetish syrupy liquor of Buenos Aires manufacture
named Aperital.) At lunch he will either consume a pint
of wine or a quart of beer, to be followed by a postprandial
cup of strong coffee and a liqueur. In the afternoon, he
will imbibe a bottle of mineral water and two cups of tea.
The dinner beverages, the same as at luncheon, consist of
beer or wine, coffee and cordial. After dinner, which is
eaten at half-past seven or at eight o'clock, he feels "filled
up" on food and liquid and has no immediate desire for
alcoholic refreshment. He now prefers to sit in front of a
café and watch the crowd pass by, but he would look out of
place occupying a seat without paying for anything, so he
orders a dish of ice cream and a refresco. A refresco is a
syrup either of currant, strawberry, raspberry, or grenadine
flavoring, covering an inch in the bottom of a tall
glass, to which is added either plain or soda water and
cracked ice. An hour after partaking of this, he orders a
whiskey and soda followed by a duplicate or a triplicate,
unless he switches to beer. He caps the whole mess off by
a cup of strong coffee.
</p>

<p>
The Porteño (so is called the inhabitant of Buenos
Aires, and which means Resident of the Port) is also a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37'>[37]</a></span>
heavy eater. For luncheon and for dinner, he is apt to
eat seven courses, four of which are meat and fish, and it
makes no difference to him if the fish comes after the meat
or before it. The dinner tables of the private houses have
white slates on which is written with a black lead pencil
the names of the dishes in the different courses as at a
table d'hôte in a hotel. In this way it leaves no surprise
nor conjecture as to which the next course will be. Maté
is passed around in the afternoon. This vile tea, brewed
from yerba maté, an herb indigenous to Paraguay, the
southern states of Brazil, and the Argentine Territory of
Misiones, is poured into a gourd and is drunk through a
metal tube with a spoonlike head, closed and perforated
with little round holes, named a <i>bombillo</i>. But one person
drinks maté at the same time. When he finishes this
"slop" the servant takes both gourd and bombillo away
from him and fills the former for the person sitting next to
him. Two rounds of it are generally partaken of. This
maté drinking, although said to be absolutely harmless, is
such a habit with the native women of the poorer classes
that they prefer it to a husband. At Tucumán, while I
was there, three such wenches got into a fight and one had
her ear bitten off. While at the police station she started
wailing; the police thinking she was howling about the pain
tried to soothe her. It transpired that she was wailing because
she left some maté boiling on the stove at her home
and nobody was left there to tend to it.
</p>

<p>
The Café Tortoni is on the north side of the Avenida de
Mayo between the streets Piedras and Tacuari. It extends
back to Rivadavia. It is the oldest café in Buenos
Aires and is owned by a nonagenarian Frenchman, Monsieur
Curutchet, who is on the job morning and night and
is still active, although the management of the establishment
is in the hands of his son, M. Maurice Curutchet. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38'>[38]</a></span>
was in front of this café that my acquaintances came at
least twice a day, and from a marble-topped iron table
beneath the street awning we observed Bonaerense life to
great advantage as it paraded by. We soon became so
accustomed to the different passers-by, many of whom
went by at the same time each day, that we soon knew
the vocations of many of the folk that were but atoms
in the large population of the great city.
</p>

<p>
There was a subway exit but a couple of rods from our
table, and it was astonishing to see how people when they
had reached the top step would stop and pant. It was
not a deep subway, but so physically poor is the average
Porteño of the middle classes on account of abuse of living
that he soon becomes exhausted. He does not live long,
and many men of forty are like men at home of sixty.
The crowd that continually passes does so with quick step,
neither looking to the left nor to the right, but straight
ahead, serious and never smiling. I noticed this and
remarked to an acquaintance about it.
</p>

<p>
"They are evidently thinking," said he, "of how they
can swindle somebody out of ten cents."
</p>

<p>
The Porteños appear to be a sad folk, and if one sees
somebody smile or hears a sound of laughter on a Buenos
Aires street, you may be sure that an Italian or a Spaniard
is present. Latins from Europe that come to Argentina
soon become like natives, depressed, excitable, and despondent.
Many Argentinos of the cities wear black
straw hats instead of white ones, which still further enhances
the funereal appearance of the men. This is a
sign of mourning, similar to the black arm bands that were
in fashion in the United States a decade ago. I know a
Philadelphia jackanapes who wanted to follow the custom
of Buenos Aires, and seeing the great number of men wearing
black hats, bought one not knowing that it was a token
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39'>[39]</a></span>
of respect for the departed relatives. He returned to
his country evidently never knowing his mistake.
</p>

<p>
The beggars, street fakirs, and peddlers on the Avenida
de Mayo are terrible. No city in the world has so many.
Neither Naples nor Las Palmas can compare with Buenos
Aires in proportion in this respect. A man seated at a
table in front of a café is never free a minute from annoyance
from this rabble. Children from five years old up to
octogenarians of both sexes systematically make multi-diurnal
rounds up to the different cafés. Some are insulting.
A narrow shouldered young man, a mixture of
degenerate and of cigarette fiend, came to a table where I
was seated and offered some chewing gum for sale. Upon
my refusal to buy any, he backed up a few steps, started
calling me names, and then walked away. A few hours
later I met him accidentally; he wilted when he saw there
was no escape. I grabbed him by the coat collar and
nearly shook the eye teeth out of him. I at least put the
fear of God into him.
</p>

<p>
The street urchins have a habit of making the rounds
of the different tables and if you are not watching, steal
the cracked ice from the dish in which it is kept in front of
you to put into your glass of refresco, according to your
desire. I caught one such boy doing this trick to me, and
slung the contents of a water pitcher at him which caught
him squarely, giving him a drenching. Near by was
seated a well-dressed Argentino who took the boy's part,
and started to call the police. As a foreigner, especially a
North American, has no rights in Argentina, I thought it
best to walk away.
</p>

<p>
There are milk depots stationed at various parts of the
city and along the Avenida where a person may enter
and for ten centavos (.042) buy a liter of milk either fresh
or cooked. These belong to La Martona and other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40'>[40]</a></span>
companies. Two ragamuffins one night entered the milk
depot at the northeast corner of the Avenida de Mayo and
Calle San José and begged some cracked ice from the
waiter behind the counter. Upon his refusal to comply
with his request one of the boys expectorated in a gallon
jar of fresh milk that stood at one end of the counter, and
which was for sale to prospective customers, and then ran
out. Do you think the man behind the counter threw the
milk out? I should say not. He merely took a large
spoon, skimmed off the expectoration, and went about his
business as if nothing had happened. I sat in a chair and
watched three other customers, who came in later, be
served from the same jar.
</p>

<p>
The lottery ticket sellers are the greatest nuisance.
They used to annoy Mr. Lane something fierce. Packer, a
man named Brown, and I noticed it so we put up several
jobs on him.
</p>

<p>
There was a legless man who made the rounds of the
cafés, being wheeled from place to place in a perambulator
by an individual who might easily as to appearance be
associated with the Black Hand. The cripple who was a
middle aged, unkempt ruffian had a multitude of lottery
tickets for sale, and was so persistent that he would
absolutely refuse to go away until he had displayed all his
wares. He seemed to take particular delight in tormenting
persons who were anxious to have him move on. A
few seconds before he was ready to be wheeled away, he
would open up a torrent of abuse upon the person who
refused to buy from him, and in this propaganda he was
ably seconded by his comrade of Black Hand mien. Mr.
Lane was of a nervous disposition and I do not believe
the Canadian Club highballs he occasionally indulged in
were any amelioration to this condition. He therefore
was considerably annoyed with this particular persistent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41'>[41]</a></span>
vagabond and his equally villainous confrère. They
"got on his nerves." We, noticing his odium for this duo,
one day when Mr. Lane was absent, hired the two vagabonds
to come to him every time they saw him seated in
front of the Tortoni and refuse to leave until ordered to
do so by the police or the waiters. A few days afterwards
while walking along the Avenida, I saw Mr. Lane seated in
front of the Café Madrid, which is a block from the Tortoni.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing over here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The Tortoni is getting too much for me; I never saw
so many vagabonds in my life as there, so I changed places.
The service and the goods are no good here; I've tried this
place three days and can't stand it. I prefer the Tortoni
but if that legless hobo ever tries to sell me a lottery ticket
again, I am going to tip him out of his perambulator into
the street even if I hang for it. I believe I shall hire the
waiters at the Tortoni to give all the street peddlers a
thrashing."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lane did so. The waiters cuffed up several of the
human pests, and the policemen arrested a few others, so
for about a week everybody was free from molestation by
the riffraff. Then they gradually came back to their usual
haunts.
</p>

<p>
There was a woman who continually made the rounds
soliciting alms by showing the bare stump of an arm
severed about six inches from the shoulder. This harridan
would take delight in walking between the tables of
the restaurants while people were at dinner and expose
this gruesome sight spoiling appetites.
</p>

<p>
Another nuisance was a woman about thirty-five years
old who had once been comely. She sold lottery tickets
and was also terribly persistent. She carried in her arms a
baby while a young child clung to her skirt. Although
this woman was a nuisance, I never thought her to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42'>[42]</a></span>
disagreeable, but for some reason Mr. Lane took an aversion
for her which could be classified in the same category
as the detest he had for the legless ruffian. One day while
being pestered by this woman, he made a grab at her
tickets, crumpled them up and slung the whole outfit in
the street. He was sorry for it afterwards and gave her a
peso to ease her. The next day, while Mr. Lane was
absent, one of our associates called the woman aside and
gave her two pesos if she would continue to display her
lottery tickets to Mr. Lane. She accepted the proposition
and did so much to his annoyance. This woman had for
a husband a whiskered Irish bum. He would come several
times a day to the subway entrance and make her hand
over the proceeds of her sales to him. He had a staff of
women selling tickets and his sole occupation was to
make the rounds collecting money from them.
</p>

<p>
There are many Irish bums in Buenos Aires, men past
middle life who years ago became stranded in Argentina
having deserted sailing vessels and who have never had
the price nor the desire to return to the Old Country.
They are strong, powerful men physically, unkempt with
long beards; their clothes are a mass of rags and teem
with vermin. Their daily occupation is to walk along
the Avenida begging alms which goes for strong drink.
At night they sleep in the doorways and in the gutter.
One such man made his rounds on the Avenida about
nine o'clock every night. Every time he passed our table
at the Tortoni, Mr. Packer would give him some money,
on one occasion the sum being a peso. As the man had
begged in Spanish, we did not know his nationality until a
certain incident happened. One particular night, Mr.
Packer was without funds when this hobo came around,
and told him so. The bum sarcastically imitated Packer
and then broke out into such a tirade of profane and obscene
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43'>[43]</a></span>
invectives and abuse in the English language, but
with a strong brogue, that I am afraid the apostles turned
over in their graves.
</p>

<p>
The policemen of Buenos Aires are efficient. They
are mostly of Indian descent and come from the far provinces.
They seldom make an arrest for misdemeanors
for there are but few street quarrels when compared to the
cities of the United States. They occasionally disperse
a bunch of young beggars who return to their posts as
soon as the "cop" has vanished. At night they make
the drunken bums vacate the street benches whither they
have repaired to sleep off the fumes of Geneva gin, which
in Spanish goes by the name of <i>ginevra</i>. Quite a few
incidents happen in the lives of the Bonaerense police, of
which here are a couple:
</p>

<p>
On the Calle Peru there is an old policeman, beloved
by nearly everybody. The storekeepers in the neighborhood
of which he is the guardian of the peace hold him in
such high esteem that at every Christmas they take up a
collection for him. For some unknown reason, a North
American named Woody, who represented the Case
Implement Company "had it in" for him. Mr. Woody
was accustomed to partake of too much John Barleycorn
and when in his cups always abused this man in strong
profane English. After awhile the old policeman caught
on that he was being made the target of abuse which he
could not understand, so one day changed beats with a
big native Argentino policeman who was of Irish extraction.
At evening Mr. Woody came along, as usual, much under
the influence of liquor. The fumes of alcohol having
dimmed his eyesight, he was oblivious of the shift that had
been made. Seeing the policeman, he opened up with his
tirade. The Irishman let him continue until Woody was
weak from lack of breath and exhausted vocabulary.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44'>[44]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Have yez finished?" the cop then asked him.
</p>

<p>
Woody astounded at hearing the policeman thus address
him, stammered an affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"Then, by Jaysus, come with me!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Woody spent the next eight days in jail until his
friends learned of his predicament and bailed him out.
</p>

<p>
The other incident is this:
</p>

<p>
One of my friends was seated one evening in front of the
Tortoni when a policeman approached him and asked him
in Spanish if he spoke English. My friend answered in
the affirmative and the policeman told him to wait there a
minute and walked away. Presently the guardian of the
law reappeared with a young Englishman who could speak
no word of Spanish. He said he was a sailor from a boat
that sailed that midnight and becoming lost did not know
how to get to it. He came on an electric car to the
Avenida de Mayo and all that he knew about the line was
that it bore a board on which was printed the name
"Cinzano." Now this is the name of a vermouth which
is widely advertised in Argentina, and he mistook the
vermouth sign for the name of the street. After considerable
difficulty, his ship was located.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, while walking down the Avenida with
Mr. Atwood Benton of Antofagasta, Chile, we saw a crowd
collected and on passing by noticed that a grown man was
slapping a little girl and dragging her around by the hair.
Not a man in the crowd had made any attempt to prevent
this outrageous scene, but all stood by with smiles of mirth
on their faces. Mr. Benton made a rush through them
and grabbing the man by the nape of the neck gave him a
sound beating and held him while I called a policeman.
When the rabble saw what Benton did, they raised an
earsplitting cheer of "bravo" for him, yet none of the
cowardly bunch dared interfere for fear of a poignard stab.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45'>[45]</a></span>
A newspaper reporter chanced by, shook Mr. Benton by
the hand, congratulated him upon his bravery, and asked
him for his card as he wished to put it in his newspaper
next day. Mr. Benton put his hand in his pocket and
extended him a card which he thought was his own, but
when the newspaper article came out in the <i>La Nacion</i> the
next day, it happened that Benton had made a mistake
and had handed the reporter a card of Mr. Percival
O'Reilley of Concepcion, Chile.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of the policemen, one sees but
comparatively few mestizos or people of mixed white and
Indian blood in Buenos Aires, when compared to the
inhabitants of other Argentine cities, yet there are plenty,
many being in the employ of the government. Dark complexions
are not as popular in Argentina as light ones;
therefore many of the <i>criollos</i> or natives whose facial
characteristics are those of the original inhabitants of the
land, beseech the photographers to put chemicals on the
plates so as to make their visages come out light in
the photograph. The descendants of Indians are called
Indios; negroes are called Negros and Chinamen, Chinos.
Many of the mestizos are nicknamed Chinos. All these
words are terms of approbation and it is funny to hear an
enraged descendant of an Indian call a white person an
Indio or a Chino.
</p>

<p>
There is in Buenos Aires a fine opera house, the Colon,
and there are many other theaters, but the most patronized
by the male public are the burlesque shows, the Casino
and the Royal. The attraction for the men in those
places are the "pick ups" that abound in the foyer, making
these music halls clearing houses for loose moral femininity.
There is no more vice in Buenos Aires than in any
other large city, but there is a peculiar system in vogue
there which is original.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46'>[46]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A woman passes down the Avenida with a basket of
flowers on her arm. She approaches the boulevardier
seated at a table and offers to sell him a flower. He buys
one and as he stretches out his hand to pay her, she slips
him a card bearing the address of a brothel but refuses the
money. These women are the hirelings of the brothel
proprietresses. Often the <i>dueñas</i> as these proprietresses
are called do the florista act (flower selling). One night,
while seated in front of the Tortoni, a famous dueña
named Carmen came along and pinned a tuberose on
an army officer. A minute later, a rival dueña named
Matilda passed by and seeing the tuberose on him, knew
who pinned it there. She tore it off, and pinned on him a
carnation. Carmen now returning from a neighboring
table saw the trick and a battle royal like between two
enraged tigers ensued. When the police put a stop to it,
the two dueñas, scratched up, and with dishevelled hair,
were obliged to make for the subway, holding up the remnants
of their torn clothing by the middle lest they should
drop off.
</p>

<p>
Among the fine buildings of Buenos Aires are the custom
house and the Central Argentine Railway station at Retiro.
This mammoth building, not yet completed, is the largest
and finest railroad station in South America. This honor
was formerly held by the Luz station in São Paulo, Brazil;
that of Mapocho in Santiago, Chile, being second. The
new Central of Córdoba Railway station is also fine.
</p>

<p>
There are in Buenos Aires but few skyscrapers in the
North American sense of the word, a fifteen-story building
being the tallest. It is the new arcade on Calle Florida
and is the largest in America. It ranks fourth in the world
in ground-floor area; those of Milan, Naples, and Genoa
being greater. There is a thirteen-story apartment house;
the Otto Wulf Building is twelve stories high, and there

are probably a dozen other buildings that exceed in height
ten stories. There are any number of seven-, eight-, and
nine-story buildings.
</p>

<p>
In Buenos Aires there are a great number of so-called
Brazilian coffeehouses where about five o'clock afternoons
people repair for coffee and ice cream. <i>Casata</i> ice
creams are a favorite. They are a mixture of flavors,
and these coffeehouses specialize in two flavors of coffee
ice cream in the same brick. The best known of these
establishments are those of Huicque and of Bibondo.
</p>

<p>
The zoölogical garden is the finest that I have ever
had the pleasure of visiting, as far as the collection of
animals is concerned, but the botanical garden is much
inferior to that of Rio de Janeiro. Palermo Park, the
great corso for automobiles, is well kept up but does not
take my fancy on account of the light shades of green
common to all trees of the Argentina flatlands. The
brilliant and variegated greens of the trees of the province
of Tucumán are lacking.
</p>

<p>
As to manufacturing, Buenos Aires is nil. There is but
one brewery within the city limits, that of Palermo, whose
product is vile. There was a so-called automobile factory
which bought parts and assembled them, but it had to go
out of business. There is not much future for manufacturing
unless iron ore is found in paying quantities in
Argentina. Without iron and without coal in Argentina,
but little can be done although there are several large oil
fields in Northern Patagonia. Rosario is a better commercial
city than Buenos Aires, but the latter will always
keep on growing and retain its lead as the metropolis of
South America.
</p>

<p>
An institution of learning worthy of mention, and
which I visited while in the Argentine metropolis is the
Colegio Nacional Mariano Moreno. It is located at 3755
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48'>[48]</a></span>
Calle Rivadavia, and is one of the best institutions of
secondary learning extant. The course comprises six
years, the first year corresponding to the ninth grade in
North American schools, and the last year being the same
as the sophomore year in our universities. It is therefore
more like a German gymnasium than a North American
high school, although it differs from both in the election
of courses. Here no Latin nor ancient languages are
taught, but other subjects such as fencing and drawing are
substituted. A good rule of the institution which is under
the able management of the rector, Dr. Manuel Derqui,
grandson of a former president of Argentina, is that no students
under fourteen years are allowed to enter, no matter
how their preparatory attainments are. This tends to
set a better standard to the instruction, although a younger
one sometimes manages to slip in. Their age upon graduation
is at least twenty. A diploma will give the graduate
entrance to any of the Argentine universities of which there
are four besides that of Buenos Aires, the others being in
La Plata, Córdoba, Sante Fé, and Tucumán.
</p>

<p>
What would seem strange to us is that the Mariano
Moreno College is a government institution, having no
connection at all with the state of municipality. The
interior of the building, with its unprepossessing façade of
four stories belies its external appearance. Its depth is
the whole length of the block. It has a swimming tank
and baths both for the instructors and students. The
whole place is kept remarkably clean. The spirit of
competition and advance is very strong among the students.
Some of their mechanical drawings, the best ones
which are on display on the walls are like the work of
experts. A student invented an adjustable and movable
drawing board which has been adopted by the drawing
classes all through the republic. The department of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49'>[49]</a></span>
physics is a marvel, although the chemical laboratory falls
short of that of some private schools in the United States,
namely that of Hackley School, Tarrytown, N. Y. I was
informed, however, that the Mariano Moreno College does
not specialize in that science, for those that desire to get a
knowledge of chemistry go to the technical schools. A
feature of the college is a recreation room for the professors
and instructors in the basement. Its walls are hung with
pictures painted or drawn by the professors. The enrollment
of students is about 1500 exclusive of 700 who are
taking a university extension course. The faculty consists
of about 150 members.
</p>

<p>
While speaking about Buenos Aires, a few words must
be said about its inhabitants and their habits. The
Porteños of the higher classes differ but little from those of
the same social sphere the whole world over, excepting
that they are more effeminate than the inhabitants of our
country. Many of the men have perfumed handkerchiefs,
and affect the Italian style of moustache. The
men of the middle classes, in attire ape the aristocracy,
but their habits are infinitely more dirty. With them a
bath is an event. When these Argentinos take a bath
they splash water around and make a great noise about it
so that the people the other side of the partitions can hear
them at their ablutions. They also spout and snort and
make a great noise every time they wash their faces,
especially if anybody is looking. This also applies to
certain men who mingle in the highest social circles. I
know a man of great prominence in Buenos Aires who
every time he took a bath would tell everybody he chanced
to meet about it. He met me one day on the street as I
was coming out of the Majestic Hotel.
</p>

<p>
"How are you?" I asked as a customary form of
greeting.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50'>[50]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"I'm feeling fine," he replied. "I just had a nice cold
bath."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later as we were walking down the
Avenida we met another acquaintance.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Señor &mdash;&mdash;," quoth the third party.
"You are looking fine to-day."
</p>

<p>
"No wonder," answered the first Argentino, "for I have
just gotten out of the bath tub."
</p>

<p>
"How strange, I also have just had a bath."
</p>

<p>
The habits of the middle and lower classes throughout
Argentina are very filthy. Clean toilets are unknown
outside of a few of the best hotels and cafés of Buenos
Aires and a few of the other large cities. In the Hotel
Colon in Buenos Aires, two men were hired constantly
just to keep the toilet clean and they did this job well.
</p>

<p>
The men of the lower classes bathe more frequently
than those of the upper and middle classes and some are
really fine swimmers. These are mostly Italians, Spaniards,
and natives who do the work and are the backbone of
the Argentine nation as they have not become affected by
contact with those of the middle classes.
</p>

<p>
There are in Buenos Aires many Jews of Galician origin.
Their ghetto is on the streets, named Junin, Ayacucho,
and Ombú, but they are likewise scattered all over the
city. Many wear corkscrew sideburns, which they smear
with grease and fondle lovingly as they converse with you.
These vile Kikes are mostly in the lottery ticket and retail
tobacco business. They have native employees whom they
send out on the street to hawk lottery tickets on commission.
This lottery business is overdone. There are
too many drawings. One takes place every week and it is
only occasionally that there is a drawing with high enough
premiums to make it worth while purchasing them.
Lottery is a good institution if properly regulated, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51'>[51]</a></span>
the annoyance that everybody is subjected to in Buenos
Aires by the peddlers of the tickets soon makes a person
wish that such an institution did not exist. Not only
are the tickets of the Benificencia Nacional sold about
the streets, but also those of the Province of Buenos Aires
which has drawings at La Plata, those of the Province of
Tucumán, those of Córdoba, San Juan, and even of
Montevideo.
</p>

<p>
These Buenos Aires Jews are the lowest class of riffraff.
Their nasty children peddle strings of garlic from door to
door. The adults are always gesticulating and trying to
cheat the stranger.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the morals, the average Porteño of the middle
class cannot be called immoral. He is unmoral because
he never had any morals to begin with. His conversation
invariably takes a lascivious turn which shows how his
thoughts runs. Seduction, feminine figures, adultery, etc.,
are his favorite themes of conversation.
</p>

<p>
Many of the women of Buenos Aires are beautiful.
Nowhere have I seen such fine-looking women, excepting
in Santiago, Chile, and in Budapest. They carry themselves
well and also know how to dress. Their figures and
taste are such that they can make the poorest material
look well on them. Their average stature is that of our
North American women; most of the young Porteñas are
neither fat nor slim, but medium. They have wonderful
black eyes and well developed busts. It is rare to see a
poor figure. It really is a treat to sit in front of a café on
the Avenida and watch them walk by. There was one
beautiful girl that took the fancy of every man that saw
her. She worked in an office and every day at noon she
would pass the Tortoni; she would repeat this again about
five o'clock in the evening. This girl was about nineteen
years old and the dainty way she tripped along absolutely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52'>[52]</a></span>
unconscious of her grace made the men rave about her.
One noon as she walked by bound for home, I followed her
a quarter of a block behind her. My intentions were to
find out where she lived and try to arrange to get an introduction
because she quite fascinated me. I found out
that she lived with her parents on Calle Montevideo. I
had a friend who lived in the block beyond her in Calle
Rodriguez Peña, but unfortunately when I called on him
to arrange for an introduction, I found out that he was on
a business trip to northern Argentina and was not expected
back for a month. As I intended leaving in a few weeks, I
was doomed to disappointment and had to swallow my
chagrin and content myself with gazing at her from the
table in front of the Tortoni when she passed by.
</p>

<p>
The amusements of Buenos Aires are few. Of course
there are some very high-class dance halls with restaurants
in connection such as Armenonville, but the hours are too
late when life begins there.
</p>

<p>
The race track of the Jockey Club is the best in the
world, and races are held every Thursday and Sunday,
but one soon gets tired of continually going to the races.
The betting is by mutuals. There are some baseball and
cricket teams in Buenos Aires which hold matches and
games on Sunday afternoons. The players are English,
American, and Canadian residents of Buenos Aires who
clerk in the banks and in the great importing houses.
The article of baseball they put out is ludicrous, and they
draw no attendance. A good primary school at home
could trim them.</p>

<p class='caption'>Scene on the River at Tigre</p>
</div>

<p>
The pleasantest of all pastimes in and about Buenos
Aires is boating at Tigre. This little town, the Argentine
Henley, is twenty-one miles north of the capital and is
reached by half-hourly service by the Central Argentina
Railway. Strange to say at this time of writing (1917) no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53'>[53]</a></span>
electric line has yet been built between the two places.
Tigre is on the Las Conchas River where it empties into
the Lujan, one of the tributaries of the La Plata. It is
thronged on Sundays by crowds from the city, who besides
rowing and canoeing, also take in the pageant from the
awninged verandas of the Tigre Hotel.
</p>

<p>
Most Argentinos do not care much for North Americans
although they are invariably polite to them. It appears
that there is a chord of jealousy somewhere against our
nation. Some of this gentry have the gall to think that
Argentina is the greatest nation on earth and these ideas
are taught them in school. I have known inhabitants of
Buenos Aires who believe that Argentina could whip the
United States in a war, although most of them have an
unwholesome fear of Chile. The British nation was not
especially popular with Argentina because in 1833 it took
the Falkland Islands from them. In 1916 Great Britain
seized a couple of Argentine vessels which it claimed
were taking contraband to the Central Powers. An anti-British
demonstration occurred on the streets of Buenos
Aires most of the participants in which were students.
Several were cut by sabers in the hands of the police but
this affray did not prevent roughnecks from yelling at
Americans and calling them names, mistaking them for
Englishmen. I unfortunately was a victim of these
insults, as I was driving one night in the Plaza de Mayo.
Even though Great Britain was not popular, neither was
Germany a favorite as can be testified by the depredations
on property of German ownership. On the night of
Saturday, April 14, 1917, a street mob attacked the
offices of two German newspapers, <i>La Union</i> and <i>Deutsche
La Plata Zeitung</i>, and broke all the windows. This same
mob also demolished the delicatessen store of P. Warckmeister
at 555 Calle Sarmiento. A few months later,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55'>[55]</a></span>
following Count Luxburg's iniquity, the mob wrecked the
Club Aleman, and tried to burn it.
</p>

<p>
Thirty miles south of Buenos Aires, is La Plata, the
capital of the Province of Buenos Aires and which has a
population of about 120,000 inhabitants. Till 1880 the
city of Buenos Aires was the capital of the province of
the same name, but in that year it detached itself from the
province and became the Federal Capital. The province,
now lacking a capital, decided to build one, and a site having
been chosen and the plans for the laying out of a city
having been approved of, the city of La Plata was formally
founded and created capital of the Province of Buenos
Aires, November 29, 1882. In 1885 the population of
the city was 13,869. The census of 1909 gave it 95,126 inhabitants
while that of 1916 gave it 111,401; the total for
the commune being 136,026.</p>

<p>
La Plata is a dull, sleepy city of broad streets and low
houses of light brown and cream-colored hues, with little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56'>[56]</a></span>
shade. The sun's hot rays scorch the pedestrian as he
walks over the sizzling pavement of the ultra-quiet and
tomblike town. I have known people who, however, prefer
La Plata to Buenos Aires, but I cannot comprehend
how a person can live there and not die of ennui. It is
laid out much on the order of Washington with broad
angling avenues cutting off slices of square and rectangular
blocks.</p>

<p class='caption'>Old Railway Station, La Plata</p>

<p>
The most artistic building in the city is the station
of the Southern Railway. It is an &oelig;uvre of M. Faure-Dujarric,
the Frenchman who was the architect for the
grandstand of the Jockey Club at Palermo Park. It is a
long and narrow white edifice with an artistic façade surmounted
by a dome of bright green tiles. Its restaurant
is said to be the best in La Plata, although I cannot verify
this statement. La Plata used to have another railway
station, even larger than the present one, and more
centrally located. Why it was abandoned I never knew,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57'>[57]</a></span>
but it stands downtown on one of the principal squares,
absolutely deserted, its long dun-colored façade an eyesore
to passers-by.</p>

<p>
Some of the largest and costliest edifices in the republic
are in this capital of the Province of Buenos Aires, but
nearly all are weather-beaten and appear much better in
photograph than they do in the original. In many cases
the stucco has fallen off in places, exposing the rough red
bricks of poor quality. Some of the façades are stained
and blackened by exposure but nothing has been done to
remedy them. The whole city is evidently laid out on too
grand a scale, and something was started that is hard to
finish. The Capitol, the governor's residence, the city hall,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58'>[58]</a></span>
the Argentine theater, the courthouse, and many other
buildings are far too large for the present need of the city,
and by the time La Plata has grown to a size where such
buildings will be adequate (it is doubtful if it ever will)
they will have long been out of style and antique.</p>

<p>
Even the cathedral, if completed, would be too grandiose.
It was started years ago, but is at present in the unfinished
state as is shown in the accompanying photograph. The
money gave out, and to-day it stands on an important
plaza, a hideous frame of cheap brick, bearing no similarity
to the elegant place of worship it was intended to be.
This tendency to start to erect a fine building, get it half
up, and then neglect it, is characteristic of all countries
where Spanish rule has once dominated. For instance, in
the same way is the Matriz church in Chillán, Chile, the
Oratory of Lopez in Asuncion, the church of the Encarnacion
at Asuncion, a church in Posadas, one in San Luis,
and the most striking example of all, the church of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59'>[59]</a></span>
Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain. In the plaza in
front of the unfinished cathedral are some marble statues,
the best of which is that representing the great Argentine
river system and named La Plata. It is an allegorical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60'>[60]</a></span>
female figure with a horn of plenty from which are spilling
fruit and vegetables, while beneath her are bundles of
wheat.</p>

<p>
The diocese of La Plata, which comprises the Province of
Buenos Aires and the territory of the Pampa, is the richest
in Argentina. It was created in 1896, and has as a bishop,
Dr. Juan N. Terreno, who has held that office since 1900.
This man is a great power in Argentine politics.
</p>

<p>
There are numerous large banks in La Plata, the largest
of which is that of the Province of Buenos Aires. Regarding
hotels, the best is the Sportsman with good restaurant.
The restaurant of the Hotel Argentina is second class.
The food is greasy and is sprinkled with flies which
become ensnared in the meshes of the oil in which the
ragoûts and filets literally float.
</p>

<p>
Outside of the Museum of Natural History which has
an admirable collection of fishes, the zoölogical garden,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61'>[61]</a></span>
the wonderful eucalyptus avenue, and a charming park,
there is in La Plata nothing to interest the stranger.
</p>

<p>
The city owes its importance to its port Ensenada, about
five miles distant and to which is dug a basin where ships
laden with grain and canned meats sail for North America
and European ports. From here also in order to avoid
the congestion in the Darsenas and in the Riacheulo at
Buenos Aires, passenger ships sail, notably the Lamport
&amp; Holt Line, which keeps up a direct passenger service
between Buenos Aires and New York. On this basin are
two large beef-packing establishments, that of Armour
and that of Swift.

<h2>
CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="s08">SAN LUIS</span>
</h2>

<p>
The average stranger coming to the United States to
see the country very seldom pays a visit to an obscure
state capital. The very contrary to this is what I did
after I had been but little over a week in Buenos Aires,
as I maintain that the only way to see a foreign country
properly is to avoid the show places and get out among the
people in the smaller cities. Knowing that San Luis was
but a short distance from the main line of the Buenos
Aires Pacific Railway between Buenos Aires and Mendoza,
and is reached by one through train daily in each direction,
I decided to stop off there.
</p>

<p>
I left Buenos Aires at three o'clock one afternoon when
the thermometer registered 100.4° Fahrenheit and was
soon traversing the flat landscape remindful of the valley
of the River Po. The white, cream-colored tile-roofed
houses, the small vineyards and vegetable gardens, the
long rows of Lombardy poplars, and the oxen hitched to
the wagons on the country roads presented a picture that
could just as well be that of northern Italy as that of the
Province of Buenos Aires. Nearly everywhere in eastern
Argentina where the country is well settled, the landscape
is decidedly Italian, due largely to the presence of the
trees indigenous to the Po Valley, originally brought
there by immigrants from that part of Europe.

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64'>[64]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The train I was on was a very poor one, the first-class
compartments being no better than third-class ones in
Germany. Thirty-four miles out of Buenos Aires, we
reached the town of Pilar, which lies a short distance
north of the railroad. Its station is the terminus of the
Buenos Aires suburban trains. Eight miles farther on
is seen on the crest of a rise of ground to the south, the
insane asylum of Open Door, a model of its kind. The
method employed for the treatment of the patients is
freedom from restraint, with the privilege to do what they
please as long as they keep within bounds. The originator
of this method of handling the insane believes that by
allowing them to follow out their whims, they will eventually
become tired of them, and that the confinement
of the demented prisoners tends to aggravate their condition.
This theory which he put into practice has had
good results.
</p>

<p>
Mercedes, seventy miles from Buenos Aires, with a
population of thirty thousand inhabitants, is the junction
of three railroads, the Central of Buenos Aires, the Western,
and the Buenos Aires Pacific. It is one of the oldest
cities in the republic and is the stamping ground of Irish
settlers who drifted in here a few generations ago and
have become rich. Unlike most Argentine cities, its
streets are numbered. Chacabuco, one hundred and
thirty-one miles from the capital, was reached about 7.30
<span class='s08'>P.M.</span> It is a stock-breeding center and is in the midst of
a rich agricultural district. One hundred and seventy-nine
miles from Buenos Aires is Junin, an important small town
from which leads a branch of the Central Argentina Railway
to Pergamino and Rosario. The place was formerly
called Fuerte Federacion from a fort on the Salado River.
As late as 1876 it was attacked by Indians, the last attack
having been made on December 10th of that year under
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65'>[65]</a></span>
the leadership of Pincen. The Indians were badly defeated
and fled, leaving behind all the stock they had stolen on
the way. A man from Junin who sat directly across the
table from me in the dining car informed me that farm
lands in the neighborhood of his city were selling at as
high as three hundred pesos a hectare. That would make
common prairie land worth there fifty dollars an acre.
During the night we crossed a corner of the Province of
Santa Fé at Rufino where the dining car was taken off.
The train then traversed the southern part of the Province
of Córdoba and entered the Province of San Luis in the
early morning.</p>

</div>

<p>
Excepting the capital, Villa Mercedes, which was
reached at 7 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span>, is the only place of importance in the
Province of San Luis. It is a well laid out little city with
a fairly good hotel, the Marconi. It was here that I
was met by J. D. O'Brien of Detroit who remained with
me for some time in the capacity of servant. He had been
gymnasium steward on the <i>Vauban</i>, and not liking the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66'>[66]</a></span>
British ship's officers, took French leave at Buenos Aires,
and decided to try his luck in Argentina. I needed a
servant as I had considerable baggage so decided to hire
him. He dropped his grip over the railing of the ship's
deck one night when nobody was watching, and fearing
arrest because he had quit the ship after signing a contract
to make a round trip, thought it would be better to
get into the country until after the <i>Vauban</i> had sailed.
Therefore I had him precede me on the journey, he going
to Villa Mercedes the day before. Dr. M. de Iriondo,
president of the Bank of the Argentine Nation, had given
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_67' name='Page_67'>[67]</a></span>
me a letter to the manager of its branch bank in Villa
Mercedes, but unfortunately I did not stop off there.</p>

<p>
There was a remarkable change in temperature compared
with the previous day, because it was now cool and
windy. The country that we now traversed was very
much like that of eastern Wyoming, only the soil was
better. There seemed to be a lack of water. Cattle
grazed the endless pampa; here and there buttes and
mountains rose from the plains, their sides covered with
coarse grass and sagebrush. At the wayside stations were
halfbreeds in ponchos, strong, good-looking fellows. Presently
the mountains came down to the railroad track
and we were in a sort of an oasis watered by the Chorillo
River.

San Luis, the capital of the thinly settled province of the
same name, is 493 miles west of Buenos Aires. It is a
poor, unpretentious, and uninteresting town of fifteen
thousand inhabitants with nothing to attract the ordinary
tourist. Its buildings, with the exception of a few on the
main streets, seldom attain a height of over one story
and are for the most part built of coarse red brick, which
here sell for 28 pesos ($11.96) a thousand. Many
of these brick buildings are plastered over, but most
are not, giving them but a half finished appearance on
account of the poor masonry. The original idea of the
man who builds a house in most of the cities of the republic
is to eventually have the brick stuccoed over, but it is
frequently the case that his money gives out, before he gets
that far, and he has to forego that luxury. There is also a
considerable number of adobe buildings. These are mostly
in the outskirts of the city. I also saw a few huts in the
outlying districts whose roofs were thatched.
</p>

<p>
There are no large fortunes in San Luis although my
informants told me that there might be one or two men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68'>[68]</a></span>
who could boast of possessing the equivalent of one million
pesos paper ($427,000.00). There are only seven automobiles
in the city, two of them being Cases; two are
Fords. The only one that I saw was of the last-named
manufacture. When asked if the governor of the province,
Señor Juan Daract, possessed one, I was told he
was too poor to own one, although his monthly salary
is 750 pesos paper ($320.25). This would make his yearly
salary from governmental sources $3843.00. I was surprised
to see horses sell so cheaply, mediocre hack ones
bringing only thirteen dollars apiece. Good mules averaged
about thirty-two dollars each.</p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69'>[69]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
None of the streets of the city are paved. On the main
one, San Martin, there are several good buildings, the Bank
of the Argentine Nation being the best. It is the newest.
The post office, the Federal Court, and the custom house
are also possible, although they are but one story high.
Nobody should overlook the Casa de Gobierno or Capitol,
which is in a class by itself. Its Renaissance façade,
which faces the Plaza San Martin, and its side which faces
one of the main streets contain sockets for nine thousand
electric light bulbs. When the building is lighted up in
all its external brilliancy, the electric meter which controls
the other lights of the city has to be shut off because the
electrical plant has not power enough to keep them both
going at the same time. So much money was expended on
the lavish decorations of the Capitol that there was not
enough left to furnish the building.
</p>

<p>
The two large plazas, Pringles and San Martin, each
contain an equestrian statue in bronze erected to the
memory of the heroes of their nomenclature. General
Pringles, the popular local hero, was born here. The
square that bears his name is the handsomest in the city.
It is bordered by giant pepper trees whose fragrance perfumes
the air. Facing it is the huge unfinished brick
basilica, the Matriz, the white dome of which is a landmark
for quite a distance, and is visible from all parts of
the city. By the side of the Matriz on the Calle Pringles
stands a small algorroba tree scarcely twenty feet high.
It is enclosed by an iron railing and is held in much reverence
by the inhabitants of San Luis, because to this tree,
the Guerrero, General José de San Martin, tied his horse
in 1816 on his westward march to Chile, where he overthrew
the Spanish dominion at the battles of Chacabuco
and Maipu.
</p>

<p>
There is an interesting old church in San Luis, that of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70'>[70]</a></span>
Santo Domingo. It is of Mission style of architecture,
and in many respects is similar to San Gabriel Mission
near Pasadena, California. Taken as a whole, San Luis
differs much from most Argentine cities. Its buildings are
of a decided Spanish colonial type of architecture. The
city has an antique appearance and is nearly gravelike as
to tranquillity.</p>

<p>
When I stepped out of the fine spick and span, five-year-old
depot, I was in a dilemma regarding which hotel to go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71'>[71]</a></span>
to. My guide book, which I never trust, and which I only
look at when I desire to kill time, favored the Español; the
landlord of the Marconi at Villa Mercedes recommended
to O'Brien the Royal; the sleeping-car conductor on the
train praised the Comercio; the cab driver extolled the
Mitre, so thither I went. The German photographer,
Streich, whom I met later in the day, boosted the Pringles,
whose landlady is German.
</p>

<p>
The Mitre, which is owned by Perez and Iglesias, is
leased to two brothers whose prenomens are Pedro and
Juan; nobody seems to know their patronymics, although
many persons seemed to be on intimate terms with them.
I later found out that their surname is Negera. When the
fat, loquacious cab driver stopped in front of their one-story
hotel, he announced my arrival by bawling out "Pedro!"
The person addressed came slouching out of the barroom,
unkempt and unshaven, and despite the earliness of the
morning fairly drunk. He reeked of alcohol. I thought
he was the porter until differently informed. Several
times in the course of the morning he came into my room
out of curiosity, each time making an excuse. In the
early afternoon he sobered up, shaved, and donned a
tuxedo. Drunk or sober, Pedro was a worker. He
waited on the table, tended bar, made the beds, swept the
rooms, and assisted in the cooking, besides doing errands
for the guests. I never saw a better hotel man. The
rooms opened onto the patios and were kept scrupulously
clean, excepting the privy, and even that was much cleaner
than in most rural South American towns. The chickens
had taken refuge in it to keep away from the lean cats,
which eyed them voraciously. Several times I had to
drive a yellow cat out of my bedroom. The food would
hardly remind an epicure of the menu of Oscar of the
Waldorf-Astoria, but as there were many people eating it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72'>[72]</a></span>
in the long rectangular dining room with its twenty-five-feet-high
ceiling, I imagine it was wholesome. Despite
the coldness of the weather (the temperature was no more
than 60° Fahrenheit, a drop of 40° from the temperature
of Buenos Aires the day before) flies abounded in my bedroom
and in the country were myriads of locusts.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the yellow cat that persisted in occupying
my bedroom, Argentine and Chilean animals have a
penchant for human society. They seem to take delight
in crawling under the beds and other furniture, and no
matter how often they are driven out they persist in
returning. A peculiar incident of this nature befell an
acquaintance of mine, Mr. Osmond of Rosario. Mr.
Osmond has lived many years in Argentina and his business
frequently takes him into the Campo, as the flat, endless
pampa is called. On one occasion he stopped at an
inn no different from the general run of inns found in all
the small towns of Argentina. A fat sow entered his room
from the patio as he sat writing. He drove her out.
Several times during the afternoon he had to repeat the
performance as the sow was bound to occupy his room.
As he lay asleep that night he was awakened by a rumpus
beneath his bed, and lighting a candle to find out the
cause of the nocturnal disturbance of his slumbers, discovered
that the sow had crawled under his bed and had
given birth to a litter of pigs.</p>

<p class='caption'>Estancia near San Luis</p>
</div>

<p>
The country in the immediate neighborhood of San
Luis is extremely fertile, although sometimes it only rains
once in a year. The Chorillos River, which rises in the
Sierra de San Luis, is dammed, and the water is drawn off
by conduits. The main dam is seven miles east of the city
and I drove out there to see it. The road passes by the
barracks and continues by fine fields of blue blossomed
alfalfa in which fat cattle and horses are grazing knee-high.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73'>[73]</a></span>
There is a primitive park on the left of the road in which
is an artificial lake, on which swains enjoy taking their
innamoratas for rowboat rides. A crude attempt at initiating
a zoölogical garden is borne out by two pens, one
of which contains a three-footed hen, the other one being
the prison of two sabors, or Argentine lionesses from the
Sierra de San Luis. A stranger is surprised at the number
of fine-looking saddle horses met on the roads. Nearly
everybody rides horseback, many with good grace and
ease of movements. The gentry use English saddles; the
poorer classes use those of Moorish type. The cab drivers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74'>[74]</a></span>
as well as the horsemen gallop their animals through the
streets at a mad pace.
</p>

<p>
The air of San Luis is healthy and invigorating. I was
surprised to note the great number of old people to be seen
in the city and its environs. In this respect it is exactly
the reverse of Buenos Aires. The men and women are
fine looking; the girls are beautiful with their laughing
black eyes, their faces brown from the sun and wind, with
a touch of rosiness to their cheeks; their figures are likewise
good. Argentinos and Spaniards alike call the
native-born criollos or criollas, according to sex, the word
meaning Creoles. It is by no means a word of contempt.
There is quite a strain of Indian blood among the inhabitants.
Seeing some dark-skinned people by the roadside,
I asked my driver if they were Indians. He laughed as he
answered: "Son Criollos como yo. Son cristianos." ("They
are natives like myself. They are Christians.") The word
Indio, meaning Indian, is one of contempt and applies only
to the members of the pagan and uncivilized tribes.
</p>

<p>
There is much natural wealth in the mountains of the
province, gold, silver, and sulphur, but nobody cares to take
the initiative about exploiting them. The unsettled country
greatly resembles the unfertile parts of California, it
being a wilderness of mesquite, chaparral, wild sage, and
juniper. There is also much cactus, the varieties ranging
from the prickly pear to the Spanish bayonet. Everywhere
that water strikes the ground, wild flowers and vines
spring up in rank confusion, the wild cucumber being
common. One of the native bushes has pods on it like a
bean, about the same size and shape, but rather oily. Of
the fruit trees, the apricot is cultivated; grape vines grow
to a large size, but their fruit is inferior to that of Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
Although the inhabitant of the central provinces of
Argentina is invariably of mixed blood, and is lacking in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75'>[75]</a></span>
the culture of the inhabitants of the cities, he is more of a
gentleman than the majority of those who belong to our
select aristocracy. He is patient but by no means humble.
Expecting no money remuneration for extending a favor or
a courtesy to a stranger, he will willingly go out of his way to
do so, but spoken to gruffly, will have nothing more to do
with him. In San Luis I asked a cab driver where there
was a good barber shop. The one he pointed out was
filled, so I went out in search of another one. He saw me
and driving down the street, overtook me, and offered to
drive me to another one. Arrived at my destination, he
refused any remuneration. The son of Pedro Nogera,
the hotel proprietor, acted as porter. Upon paying my
bill, which was trivial when compared with the services
rendered, I offered the boy a small tip. He refused, saying
that I had paid for what I had received. Who is there
in such stations of life at home that would refuse a tip?
Most would be angry if it was not given, and if the sum was
too small, would go off grumbling. One of the peasants
of San Luis that I consider a gentleman was my regular
cab driver. Born in San Luis, he had never been out of
the province. His name is Antonio L. Rójo. In appearance
he is of large build, somewhat coarse, and inclined
to stoutness. For the sum of one and a half pesos (61 c.)
an hour, he agreed to drive me whenever and wherever I
wished to go. Although inclined to be loquacious, he
showed none of that grossness and vulgarity of character
that our cab drivers are apt to demonstrate. This man
knew his position and was most attentive in showing
me the points of interest of the city and neighboring
country. He was also well read in politics but never
knocked. Occasionally he would stop and pick from the
roadside fruit or flowers indigenous to the country to show
me what grew in the neighborhood of San Luis. Upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76'>[76]</a></span>
leaving San Luis, I gave him a tip of five pesos ($2.14).
This at first he refused to accept and only took it finally
by my literally forcing it upon him. He was so delighted
with the money that he took a railroad trip to Balde, nine
miles distant, to visit some relatives, and on the way offered
to spend some of it to treat me.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after leaving San Luis, westward on the railroad
to Mendoza there is seen to the south the large brackish
Lake Bebedero; it keeps in view a considerable distance.
The short cut of the Buenos Aires Pacific skirts its southern
end. The second station west of San Luis is Balde, a
collection of straw and brushwood huts, the abodes of the
peasants. One well, which supplies the whole community,
has been sunk, water having been struck at a depth of
2119 feet. It is artesian. Fifty-one miles west of San
Luis, the Desaguadero River, muddy and deep, lying in a
chasm between high clay banks, is crossed. This river
forms the boundary line between the provinces of San Luis
and Mendoza. The country is a flat wilderness of mesquite
which grows much larger than in our southwestern
States, probably on account of the superiority of the soil,
which here is a light clay. There is a considerable amount
of alkali, but not in so marked a degree as in the western
plains of North America. The mesquite, which grows
to a great size, some of the trees having veritable trunks,
is chopped and is used as cord wood and also as fuel on the
freight and passenger trains.
</p>

<p>
La Paz, not to be confounded with the Bolivian metropolis,
nor with the Entrerieno town of the Paraná River, is
reached shortly before one o'clock in the afternoon on the
daily passenger from San Luis to Mendoza. It has two
thousand inhabitants and is seventy-four miles west of
San Luis and eighty-eight miles east of Mendoza. It is
important for here begins the cultivated zone which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77'>[77]</a></span>
extends as far as the Andes and which is known as the
Zona del Riego. The estancia limits and the country
roads are all bordered by Lombardy poplar trees, planted
closely together. Our North American farmer who
plants his fence trees a rod apart would be astonished
to here behold them a yard apart. Notwithstanding their
proximity to one another, they here attain a goodly height.
Some pest seemed to have attacked many of these trees.
Many of the leaves were turning brown and the trees
dying. It is a curious fact that where this species of tree
abounds, goiter is prevalent among the inhabitants. In
northern Italy, parts of Hungary and Croatia, and in
certain sections of the United States where there are many
Lombardy poplars, people are seen with this affliction.

CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="s08">MENDOZA</span>
</h2>

<p>
From Dr. A. R. Davila, proprietor of <i>La Prensa</i>, South
America's largest newspaper, I received a letter of introduction
to one of Mendoza's best known and wealthiest
men, Dr. Juan Carlos Serú, a lawyer and country proprietor,
who resides in a fine residence at 1055 Avenida
San Martin. I went to see him to pay my respects and
from him obtained some valuable information.
</p>

<p>
Up to the present time viticulture has been the staple
industry of the Province of Mendoza, the landscape being
covered with vineyards as far as the eye can see. This
business has been on such an increase that it has now
reached its climax for Mendoza wines have not been
exported out of the country to any extent. With the
opening up of Neuquen Territory, which is likewise
adapted to the growing of grapes, the market will be more
than flooded and there will not be much future in the
business unless there should be a large export trade.
Steps have already been taken to introduce Mendoza
wines into Brazil which have so far met with success.
Since the European war, the price of grapes has dropped
and many of the small proprietors have been forced to
the wall. The large ones and old established firms have
managed to reap the profits. The value of the vineyards
all depends on their proximity to a railroad or to the city
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79'>[79]</a></span>
of Mendoza. Dr. Serú owns seventy hectares of vineyard
two stations distant from San Rafael, a wine producing
district in the southern part of the province, which he
values at three thousand pesos paper to the hectare; this
would bring the value of a vineyard at the height of its
production to approximately $512.40 an acre.
</p>

<p>
One of the largest <i>bodegas</i> (wineries) is that of Tomba
y Sella in Godoy Cruz, a suburb of Mendoza. It was
originally a private concern owned by Antonio Tomba.
A scrap among the heirs caused a division and it is now a
stock company with Domingo Tomba as president and
the largest shareholder. The wine is kept in cement
casks. The most famous bodega, although not one of
the largest, is that named Trapiche, owned by the Benégas
Brothers, situated about three miles southwest of Mendoza.
It has agencies in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, Tucumán,
Bahia Blanca, and in Paraná. One of the brothers
lives in Buenos Aires where he conducts show rooms and a
sales agency at 420 Calle Florida, while the others live in
Mendoza, supervising the manufacturing end. I went
to their bodega with Mr. Serú and was shown through the
whole institution by the manager. The vineyard comprises
538 acres. The winery at the time of my visit was
about filled and has the following capacity:

<p>
To this must be added 9000 barrels of 200 liters, total
1,800,000 liters, which brings the grand total to 4,860,000
liters capacity. These 9000 barrels mostly contain a
brand of red wine named Reserva which sells for $51.24 a
barrel. The wine sold in the bottle is 7/10 of a liter for it
takes 280 bottles to fill the barrel. Perkeo of Heidelberg
surely would have had a high old time if turned loose in
the Trapiche wine cellars. Seven-tenths bottle of ordinary
Reservada which retails in Mendoza at ninety-seven
cents is selling now in Italy among the Mendocino Italians,
who have returned home on account of the war, at $1.76.
The Benégas Brothers manufacture seventeen brands of
wine and two brands of unfermented grape beverage.
The manager, who showed me around, must have thought
I had a saintly countenance, for when I left the institution,
instead of handing me some wine to sample, he poured out
for me a tumbler of grape juice. I do not want the readers
of this book to draw the conclusion from this that I left
Mendoza without refreshing myself with some of the real
article. The Tomba is the largest of all the bodegas, and
there are many larger than the Trapiche; the Barra Quero
being one of them.
</p>

<p>
Not only do the Benégas Brothers manufacture wine
and grape juice, but they have lately installed a cold-storage
system at their plant for the preservation of grapes
which are sent to Buenos Aires and other parts of the
country to be eaten in the élite restaurants and in the
homes of the wealthy. One kilogram (2⅕ pounds) of
table grapes from their vineyards retails in Buenos Aires
from 56 cts. to $2.14 according to their quality.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Serú, seeing the results obtained from viticulture in
this province was one of the first men to conceive the idea
of growing fruit for canning as has been done in California.
On his estate near San Rafael, he had some canned which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81'>[81]</a></span>
he sent to Buenos Aires to compete with some articles
from California. His product was found to be superior
and to-day he has one of the best fruit <i>fincas</i> in the republic.
Gath y Chaves, the great department firm which
has branches in every large town in the republic have
decided to accept, for their trade, no other brands than his.
This is a big feather in his cap because Gath y Chaves is
the largest firm of its kind in South America. Dr. Serú is
now endeavoring to get North American capital interested
in Mendocino lands for he is of the opinion that fruit will
eventually supersede viticulture. Fruit lands average
about $51.24 an acre; orchards of plums, apricots, peaches,
and pears, six years old, will cost the purchaser $683.20
an acre. These figures are nearly exact regarding their
present worth (1917), and if anybody who reads this book
goes to Mendoza, not knowing conditions there, they
should not be bluffed by other figures as these are nearly
correct, they having been given to me by viticulturists
and fruit growers of repute.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza has been hit rather hardly in the question of
labor for three thousand Italians alone have emigrated
from the province to return home on account of the
European war. Business is now at its lowest ebb, but of
all the provinces of the republic, it has undoubtedly the
brightest future. It is going to be a great granary, and
wheat is going to play an important part in its exports.
Everything is grown by irrigation, and it has been found
that grain grown this way there doesn't rot or soften as it
does in other districts under similar conditions. Under
ordinary conditions, the wheat yield in Mendoza is fifty-two
bushels to the acre; that of the whole republic is
only twenty-three. A man on an experimental farm
grew ten acres that averaged seventy-six bushels to the
acre; figures that I had hitherto thought impossible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82'>[82]</a></span>
There is no flour mill in the province; neither is there one
in the neighboring province San Juan. Sr. Emilio Vogt,
manager of the Molino del Rio de la Plata, the largest
flour mill in Argentina, which has a capital of $14,945,000,
tells me that a flour mill either in Tucumán or in Mendoza
would be a profitable investment. One with a daily
capacity of 30 tons would cost 300,000 pesos ($138,100.00).
It would need 200,000 pesos ($85,400.00) extra for working
capital, bringing the total to 500,000 pesos ($223,500.00).
He says he would guarantee a mill like this to make forty
per cent. annually on the original investment. It would
have all it could do to supply Mendoza city alone. Vogt
says that in the flour business in Argentina, everything
depends on the freight. The grain belt at the present
time is midway between Buenos Aires and Mendoza.
Wheat is shipped to Buenos Aires to be ground and the
flour then shipped back over the same rails and beyond
to Mendoza. This cuts a big hole in the profits. Since
Mendoza is destined to be a great wheat country, the
grain won't have to be shipped far to the mill if one is
established there.
</p>

<p>
The city of Mendoza according to the census of 1916
had 59,117 human inhabitants. Its neighbor, Godoy
Cruz had a population of 16,021. The canine population
of both of these cities outnumbers that of the human
in a proportion of at least three to one. Only two dogs
out of this vast number are of any consequence and they
are on exhibit in the zoölogical gardens. The other dogs
are not worth the powder to blow them up.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of Buenos Aires, Mendoza is undoubtedly
the finest city in Argentina and is the liveliest
of the provincial capitals. It is a beautiful place with
many broad avenues bordered by symmetrical rows of
sycamore, plane, and linden trees. All the streets of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83'>[83]</a></span>
newer part of the town are well paved with rectangular
cobble stones. Between the road and the sidewalk
are ditches paved with round polished stones and spanned
by bridges under which rivulets of muddy water flow.
I have been told that in this respect, Mendoza bears a
similarity to Guatemala. The sidewalks are paved with
tile of various somber colors and designs. The residences
are mostly one story in height built of a brownish brick
or of adobe and stuccoed. The town presents an extremely
verdant and refreshing appearance largely due to
the murmuring of the running water that is everywhere.
</p>

<p>
The Plaza San Martin, the principal one, though to me
not as charming as the Plaza Pringles in San Luis, is the
finest in the republic. In its center is a large equestrian
statue of the guerrero, San Martin, looking towards the
Andes. From its center, eight walks, the tile paving
of which cost the city forty thousand dollars, radiate, the
four center ones containing little islands of flowers. The
corners of this plaza which are sunk about two feet below
the level of the street are round. In this neighborhood
much of the activity of the city centers for here are the
Grand Hotel, Hotel Bauer, the cathedral, the Spanish
Bank of the River Plate; the Bank of the Province of
Mendoza (a huge building in construction); the Bank of
the Argentine Nation and the Municipal Theater. Nearby
is the post office.
</p>

<p class="p2">
There is another plaza, that of Independencia, which is
still in an embryo state. It contains four city squares
and when finished is expected to be a masterpiece. Work
of grading is now in progress but it is being done so slowly
that I conjecture the year 1920 may not witness its completion.
In the meantime horses graze on the tall grass
and alfalfa that will be eventually dug up to be planted to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84'>[84]</a></span>
trees and lawn. This is supposed to be the exact geographical
center of New Mendoza and on it faces the capitol
and governor's residence. Both these edifices are but
one story in height; the former covering an entire block.</p>

<p>
The city is divided into nearly equal parts by a broad
avenue, that of San Martin, formerly the Alameda which
runs north and south.
</p>

<p class="p2">
These two parts are called by the distinctive names of
Mendoza which is the western section and Old Mendoza,
the eastern one. Old Mendoza, which I think contains
the greatest population is in the form of a trapezoid, while
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85'>[85]</a></span>
the new city is that of a square. The old city was the
part that existed before the earthquake of 1861. It was
nearly totally destroyed and has been rebuilt again. The
best to do inhabitants instead of repairing their ruined
homes, laid out plans for a new and better city with wide
streets and spacious parks. It is this new part that to-day
is the most important. Old Mendoza with its one-story,
primitive adobe buildings, in some respects resembles San
José de Costa Rica, although it is not nearly as fine and
clean a city. Its streets are treeless and most of them
are never paved. The poor element lives here. The old
plaza with its dirt walks, which was formerly the center
of the city, is a full mile from that of San Martin. The
ancient crumbling unstuccoed adobe pile which was the
pristine city hall is now an almshouse. There are no
residences in Mendoza which can be termed palatial, that
of my acquaintance, Dr. Serú being the best. It is a two-story
structure on the wide and shadeless Avenida San
Martin, hemmed in on both sides by shops. The residence
of Domingo Tomba at Godoy Cruz is the finest
house in the province, but it is in a poor location, on the
busy and dusty plaza of that small city.</p>

<p>
Regarding the earthquake in Mendoza, "Until 1861,"
writes Dr. Martin de Moussy, "the Province of Mendoza
was not aware of the terrors of an earthquake. The violent
shocks that had at different times agitated the Chilean
provinces seemed to lose their intensity on going over the
chain of the Andes. The inhabitants only knew slight
tremblings of the earth previous to then. March 20, 1861,
one of the most violent earthquakes ever recorded destroyed
in a few seconds the city of Mendoza and buried
one-half of its inhabitants under its ruins."
</p>

<p>
At 8:30 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> that night, the town was totally destroyed
by one of the most violent earthquakes ever experienced.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87'>[87]</a></span>
The sky was perfectly clear; the atmosphere quiet; the
greater part of its inhabitants at home, although some of
them were enjoying a walk in the Alameda and on the
plaza. Suddenly a subterranean noise was heard, and at
the same moment before there was time to escape, all the
public buildings and private houses were falling in with a
tremendous crash. The walls fell outward and all sides of
the rooms and the roofs came down in the center so that
the inhabitants, both those who were inside the houses
and those who were on the streets were all buried beneath
the débris. The movement was first undulatory from
northwest to southeast and afterwards seemed to come
from below upwards. Its violence was so great that in the
gardens many people fell down. In the Church of San
Augustin, where mass was being held, only one person
escaped alive. He was a drunken man asleep in the vestibule.
The pillars fell in such a way that he was uninjured.
Fire started by broken lamps and from kitchen braziers.
The débris of the earthquake clogged the canals and
started a flood. Food ran short and the stench of the
corpses which could not be taken from the ruins was awful.
The fire raged ten days. When everything was normal
again, it was estimated that at least ten thousand people
perished. The <i>Almanaque del Mensajero</i> gives the total
number of victims at fifteen thousand. The shocks were
continued at frequent intervals until the end of May.
There was a suggestion to rebuild the city on some granite
hills known as Las Tortugas but old ties and affections
pervaded so a new city was built directly west of the
Alameda which is now the Avenida San Martin. The
ruins of the churches of San Francisco and San Augustin
should be visited.
</p>

<p>
The Parque Oeste (West Park) which its name indicates
is in the western part of the city. It is built on a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88'>[88]</a></span>
scarcely perceptible general slope, and to my idea out-rivals
that of Palermo in Buenos Aires, it being more
natural and rustic. It is not yet entirely completed, but
that part of it which is, nearly attains a perfection. It
is spacious and its broad avenues, cross lawns planted to
trees indigenous to the country. There is a fine music
pavilion and a zoölogical garden there.
</p>

<p>
Westward from this park and past the hospital in the
course of construction, a broad road bordered by year-old
Carolina poplar trees takes one to the mile distant Cerrito
de la Gloria a 1300 foot hill which rises abruptly from the
desert Pampa. Its eastern slope is planted to eucalyptus,
various generi of cactus, pepperberry, and other trees and
shrubs. Dependent on water which is forced through a
conduit to the top of a hill, they have in the three years
of their existence here attained a marvelous growth on
what was formerly a barren waste. Serpentine automobile
roads with no balustrades coil upwards around the hill.
It would be no place for a joy ride. A driver in very
sober senses drove off the road in broad daylight in August,
1915. The only occupant of the victoria beside himself
was a young girl. They both saved their lives by jumping
but both the horses rolled over into the ravine and were
killed.</p>

<p>
The summit of this hill is crowned by a gigantic monument
of granite and of bronze erected in 1914 by the
Argentine Republic in commemoration of the Army of
the Andes which crossed that giant barrier and defeated
the Spaniards at Maipu and at Chacabuco in Chile. It
was unveiled on the centennial day on which the army left
Mendoza. The monument is a Goddess of Victory looking
northward. (It was northward through Villavicencio
that San Martin's army went.) The granite pedestal
formed from three huge blocks of massive rock has embedded

after their victory. On top of the bas relief is shown the
number of men comprising the conquering army, classified

As to hotels, Mendoza can boast of none that are first-class
according to the standard of those of the average
European or North American city of its size, although
the Jewish hotel of Emilio Lévy which tries to be international
and neutral (but which is not), is the best. It is
named Grand Hotel San Martin but in colloquial conversation
the suffix San Martin is usually left out. Lévy is
an Alsatian Jew as well as are his immediate entourage of
hirelings and some of the printed sheets of German atrocities
in this European conflagration that his clerks distribute
on the dining-room tables and in the corridor are
evidence to show the wandering Briton or Frenchman
that his money is solicited even though he may receive
kosher food for it in return. The rooms are large and
clean, most of them opening on to a patio as is the custom
of the hotels in provincial Argentina. The food is good
but I am sorry to say that it is lacking in quantity as well
as in variety. Three years ago, while I was in Mendoza,
this same hotel set a fine meal and a large one but one must
take into consideration that the greater the variety of food
as well as the quantity, the greater is the cost, and Jews
are always out for the money. The Apulian bartender
knows how to draw a nice schuper of Quilmes beer, but I am
told that the barman of the Hotel Bauer across the plaza
on the Calle General Necochea keeps his draught beer
better. The only serious objection I have to the Grand
Hotel is its middle class Yiddish clientele of all nationalities
who stare rudely at the other guests and while eating,
wave their forks and knives as they loudly explain some
anecdote.
</p>

<p>
The Hotel Bauer, patronized by Teutons, runs largely
to café and barroom which are the only departments of this
institution in evidence from the street. The dining room
and the bedrooms are in the rear, but the bedrooms are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92'>[92]</a></span>
small. The Hotel Italia is "free and easy." They have
a regular rate but if a person brings a woman companion
to his room who is not his wife or of any consanguinity, he
is charged double.
</p>

<p>
Mendoza is no smokers' paradise. Cigars dry up in the
dry atmosphere and become as crisp and brittle as tinder
and as dry as powder. As to amusements, there are none
save a few cinematograph shows and a bagnio named
Petit Eden. One of these moving picture shows was
showing films of the Willard-Johnson fight. It was such
an attraction that the place was jammed. I had seen no
moving pictures of the fight as yet, although I wanted to,
as I had witnessed the genuine article in Havana. I was
dumbfounded at the finale after the twenty-sixth round
to see my visage conspicuous in the foreground displayed
upon the white canvas, as I did not know that I had been
within range of the camera while at the fight in Havana.
</p>

<p>
The Province of Mendoza is rich in mineral springs due
to the volcanic Andes. The most famous of these springs
is that of Villavicencio about sixty miles northwest of the
capital in the fastnesses of the mountains. It was through
here that San Martin marched his army on his way to
Chile. He came out at the point where the railroad now
lies at the farm of Uspallata. The Mendoza agents of
the Argentine Brewery have bought the spring and transport
its waters in bulk to Mendoza where they bottle it.
</p>

<p>
To the north of the Province of Mendoza lies the Province
of San Juan with an area of 33,715 square miles. It
together with Mendoza and San Luis, formerly formed
the Province of Cuyo which belonged to that part of the
Spanish dependencies that were governed from Santiago,
Chile. In character, San Juan is much like Mendoza
although it has less fertile lands. This is due to the fact
that while Mendoza has three rivers which serve to irrigate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93'>[93]</a></span>
it, San Juan has but one. San Juan is noted for
the superior quality of its figs which here thrive to perfection.
Its capital city is also named San Juan. It is
ninety-eight miles north of the city of Mendoza and is
reached by the Buenos Aires Pacific Railway which here
has its terminus. It is a small town of 14,595 inhabitants
with shady streets and of ancient appearance. Most of
its houses are of adobe. It is also the seat of the bishopric
of Cuyó. The bishop is José Américo Orzali who has held
this post since 1912.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Mendoza westward, the narrow gauge Transandine
Railway runs parallel to the canal of the Mendoza
River and crosses it twice. Several kilometers out, the
snow-capped peaks of the Andes are visible, among them
Aconcagua, South America's highest mountain and extinct
volcano in Argentina near the Chilean line. This great
height of twenty-four thousand feet was first ascended by
E. A. Fitz Gerald after several efforts, but since then it
has been scaled several times, there being guides at Puente
del Inca to take mountain climbers to the summit.</p>

<p class='caption'>Waiting for the Train at Cacheuta</p>
</div>

<p>
Twenty miles from Mendoza, we enter the defile of the
Mendoza River, and are in the midst of the Andes. I left
the train at Cacheuta, where at that thermal resort, I
put in forty-eight hours. There are hot springs at Cacheuta
and a small establishment was built as they were
found to contain qualities beneficial for rheumatism and
kindred ailments. The trade of the place increased until
it became necessary to drill holes into the ravine bottom
to pump the hot water out for baths. The patient is apt
to get worse for the first five days after the beginning of
this treatment, but then gets better and improves until
the course is completed. The Gran Hotel Cacheuta is a
sumptuous and luxurious affair built on the style of which
we are erroneously led to believe is Cliff Dweller architecture
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94'>[94]</a></span>
like the Hotel El Tovar at the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado. I was not long there before I found out
that the main attraction of Cacheuta was not the baths
but instead roulette and nickel-in-the-slot machines. The
first mentioned game was in full swing; a separate building
was given over to that form of joy producer. Chips cost
a peso apiece, except for the three dozen, red and black,
and odd and even, where a five-peso chip must be thrown
on the green cloth. Little girls not more than twelve
years old watch their beplumed and besapphired mammas
win or lose. Long-robed priests wander back and forth,
occasionally placing a bet where their holy inclination tells
them to; vermouth glass in hand, they are seen in the barroom
to walk up to the products of Mills and of Caille and
to the tune of a twenty-centavo piece watch for their luck.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95'>[95]</a></span>
In the way of scenery and other attractions besides the bath
there is nothing at Cacheuta to divert one's time. It is a
society place for gambling and a place for rest for the tired
business man. It is wonderful, however, to see what man
has done in a place not favored by nature. The barren
mountains obscure the view in all directions; the sandy
soil can bear no vegetation. Here and there are to be
seen the corrugated iron huts of the railroad workmen in
front of whose doors their numerous brown-skinned offspring
are playing. Through the whole scene runs the
turbulent Mendoza River, muddy with silt and sand.</p>

<p>
Not far above Cacheuta is Potrerillos, where it is pleasant
to see a speck of green. Steers graze in alfalfa fields
enclosed by tall poplar trees. A stock company was
formed to bore a tunnel two kilometres through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96'>[96]</a></span>
mountains to the plain, deviate the stream from its course
by running it through this tunnel and which once through,
would irrigate new lands. As it would also render waste
the lands now under cultivation, the wine growers and
agriculturists served an injunction on this company
stopping them in their undertaking. The tunnel is completed,
but it is a hundred to one shot nothing will ever
come of it for the company tried to steal the river.</p>

The whole trip to Santiago over the Andes so often described
is one of great scenic beauty on the Chilean side
where the descent is very abrupt and where one can look
down the whole length of the valley of the Aconcagua
River which is cultivated where nature will allow. That
on the Argentina side is grand with the giant peaks in the
neighborhood, and also awe-inspiring, but it is apt to be
tedious. The last stop of importance in Argentina is
Puente del Inca, where there is a thermal establishment
and electrical works. Here there is a natural bridge under
which the Mendoza River flows and which gives the place
its name. High up on the mountain side are curious
groups of rocks which from the valley appear like people
praying. They are named the Penitentes. The crest of
the Andes is pierced by a tunnel at an altitude of 10,364
feet. This tunnel is 9848 feet long, 5460 feet of it being
in Argentina and the remaining 4388 feet being in Chile.
It takes eight minutes to run through it on the train. In
the winter time when snow blocks the passes so it is
impossible for trains to run, travelers between Argentina
and Chile ride through this tunnel on horseback. About
1500 feet above the tunnel at the summit of the Cumbre
there is a statue of Christ the Redeemer (Cristo Redentor),
seen by me on several occasions as I have crossed the
mountains on horseback. It was designed by the Argentine
sculptor Matteo Alonso. It is of bronze and is over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97'>[97]</a></span>
twenty-nine feet in height. It was unveiled at a mass said
on the top of the Cumbre in March, 1904, as a monument
of perpetual peace between Argentina and Chile in the
presence of the presidents of the two republics. There
had been a scrap over the boundary question and both
countries were on the verge of war. It was a case of one
being afraid and the other dare not, Chile probably holding
the pole. Chile was unable to obtain a loan and therefore
war was averted. The image of Christ with his arms
extended is looking southward and the boundary line of
the two countries runs through His center. Since the
traffic on the Cumbre has greatly lessened on account
of the tunnel, this bronze Christ has fallen into neglect.
Storms have knocked the cross out of his hands, and in
many ways have damaged it. The Chilean mozos who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99'>[99]</a></span>
cross the Andes to work in the electrical works at Puente
del Inca, use this statue as a target when they pass by it
and when I saw it, it was quite pock-marked with the
bullets from their revolvers. One hundred meters north
and one hundred metres south of the statue are two iron
poles named "itos" which demark the boundary.</p>

<p>
The poor travelers still go over the Cumbre. They hire
mules for fifty pesos Chileno apiece ($4.90) at Los Andes,
leaving there early in the morning long before daybreak and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100'>[100]</a></span>
arriving at the Argentine station of Las Cuevas in the afternoon
in time to catch the afternoon train to Mendoza.
</p>

<p>
At Santa Rosa de los Andes down the valley of the
Aconcagua at an altitude of 2698 feet, we changed trains
for here we reached the broad gauge of the Chilean State
Railways. It is a pleasure to be able to travel again in
clean and comfortable cars. Those of Argentina are
terrible; they are dirty, old, and worn. The toilets are
dirty and the lavatories are generally lacking in towels.
In Chile are Pullman cars of American manufacture; the
locomotives are local, or are made in Germany. I came
from Cacheuta on the special car sent by the Argentine
Government to convey the special ambassadors and envoys
with their distinguished guests to the inauguration ceremonies
and installation of the new President of Chile, Sr.
Luis Sanfuentes, who succeeded Sr. Ramon Barros Luco,
whose term expired December 23, 1915. This party
included Romulo S. Naón, special ambassador, Colonel
Carlos S. Martinez, military attaché, Captain José Moneta,
naval attaché, Sr. Iriondo de Irigoyen and Sr. Albert
d'Alkaine, secretaries to the Embassy and myself. Brazil
was represented by Senhor Luis Martins de Souza Dantas,
special ambassador. Portugal sent her minister to
Argentina, Colonel Botelho, a very quiet miniature old
man and his military attaché, Colonel Martin de Lima, a
middle-aged small gentleman. At Los Andes, we were
met by the welcome committee of the Chilean government,
its units being the pick of the land politically, socially, and
from rank in military and naval affairs. After being
photographed and presented with flowers by comely
maidens dressed in white, who came to greet us and who
sang a song especially composed for our honor, we were
escorted to a private train where we were dined and wined
on the way to Santiago.

<h2>
CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="s08">SALTA AND TUCUMÁN</span>
</h2>

<p>
Mr. William Boyce, of the Chicago Saturday <i>Blade</i>,
made a trip to Tucumán and wrote a chapter about it in
his book, <i>Illustrated South America</i>. This book I read
with pleasure and determined that I should visit that city
if ever an opportunity presented itself. One morning,
armed with credentials and letters of introduction to
prominent personages in the far provinces, I boarded the
train for Tucumán. Two railroads connect Buenos Aires
with Tucumán, the Central of Córdoba and the Central of
Argentina. I traveled by a train that runs over the rails
of the latter.
</p>

<p>
Mariano Saavedra, 288 miles north of Buenos Aires is
the town where the River Plate scenery ends, and the vast,
monotonous plains begin. Up to here through the broad
expanse of corn fields, whose limits are bounded by the
horizon; past funereal towns of unpointed red brick buildings,
the open doors and windows of which have the aspect
of morgue entrances and apertures; past mournful
cemeteries of blackened crosses; and past peasant houses
embowered in groves of weeping willows, the dirty tri-weekly
express train sped us by in a cloud of stifling, blinding,
eye-smarting, ear-filling dust. At Mariano Saavedra
we come to the unbounded, limitless plain of coarse green
grass on which myriads of cattle graze. This, the province
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102'>[102]</a></span>
of Santa Fé, is the true plain of Argentina. From
history and from fiction we imagine the great plains
to be the central and the southern provinces, consisting
of what is geographically the western part of the province
of Buenos Aires, the Province of San Luis, and the territory
of Pampa. This is not the true fact. In all these
geographical divisions are rolling hills, and streams in
deep-lying canyons. Here in Santa Fé, I doubt if there is
a single hill. A broad landscape, dry and dusty but by no
means rainless, and yet fruitful, meets the eye of the
traveler. A dark cloud on the horizon approaches, and
when overhead breaks into a swarm of locusts, which in
many instances destroy in a single day the whole untiring
year's work of the farmers. They are not such a pest as
they were in former years, but yet a terrible scourge.
</p>

<p>
At 10:30 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> the town of Ceres is reached. This place,
a railway division point, is built at the corners of the
provinces Santa Fé, Córdoba, and Santiago del Estero,
the last-named province being that which the train now
enters and which it takes all night to cross. Do not
imagine that this dusty, smoky town is named after
the Goddess of Agriculture. It is a synonym of all that is
evil among human inhabitants, namely overwhelming
dust, locomotive smoke, and locusts which dart through
the empty windows of the coaches like hot coals, and are
pulled out of ones food, beer, hair, pockets, and even
underdrawers, of all sizes and shapes from three inches
downwards, never failing to expectorate a dark brown
sputum, like tobacco juice but purulent.

I sat in the dining car with a young dentist named
Hallmann, of German birth but who had an American
diploma. He resides at Santiago del Estero where he
made twenty thousand dollars at his profession during
the last two years. There is only one other dentist in that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103'>[103]</a></span>
city, an American, but Hallmann says the latter has no
trade because he is drunken. He told me that in Santiago
del Estero he was always obliged to accept cash before he
pulled a tooth on account of the swindling tendency of the
natives. Several months later, I accidentally met Hallmann
on the Avenida in Buenos Aires. He had made
enough money in Santiago del Estero and was on his way
to Philadelphia, where he had formerly practiced, to open
up an office.
</p>

<p>
The Province of Santiago del Estero has an area of
39,764 square miles and a population of 264,911. It
is a plain varying from 450 to 550 feet above sea level.
Its climate is extremely hot. Most of the surface of
the soil is covered with a dense brush of mesquite and
quebracho trees, which are cut into cordwood and used as
fuel on the locomotives. The capital city is Santiago del
Estero, frequently spoken of in Argentina as Santiago.
It is an antiquated city of seventeen thousand inhabitants
and is one of the oldest towns in the republic having been
founded in 1553 by Francisco de Aguirre on the Dulce
River. It is the seat of a bishopric, which was created in
1908. The present incumbent is Dr. Juan Martin de
Yañiz y Paz. On account of its isolation, Santiago del
Estero has not prospered as it should have.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants of the Province of Santiago del Estero
are mostly dependent for a livelihood on the sale of quebracho.
This wood which rarely attains a growth of
thirty feet is of a deep red color and is used as a dye wood.
Its supply seems inexhaustible but its export is now at a
standstill on account of a slump in the market. It thrives
in dry climates for in this province where it frequently
goes for a stretch of seven months at a time without a
rain, it attains its perfection. The northern provinces of
Argentina have it over its southern neighbors in the fact
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104'>[104]</a></span>
that no matter how dry the country is, if it lies within the
proper altitudes it is forested.
</p>

<p>
I have heard the Province of Tucumán spoken of by
Argentinos as having a tropical climate. Such is not the
truth, but it is, in climate, the nearest approach to the
tropics of any of the other Argentine provinces, with
the exception of the lowlands of Salta that lie within the
La Plata watershed. All nations are apt to exaggerate
their endowments of nature, therefore one should not too
sharply criticize the Argentinos when they speak of Tucumán
as tropical. The Germans call part of Saxony,
"Sächische Schweiz," when it bears no more resemblance
to Switzerland than does a pot of ink to a bucket of milk.
The Uruguayans love to style their land "The Greenland
of South America," and even the Paraguayans call their
mountains the "Himalaya Mbaracayu." The only
similarity of Tucumán to the tropics is the excessive heat
in summer, and the prevalence of fevers, the most noteworthy
being a form of malaria, named <i>chuchu</i> which is
also in Santiago del Estero, Jujuy, and Salta. A more
fever-free country is hard to imagine from the lay of the
land, yet I am sorry to say that the Argentine Board of
Health statistics belie it. Malaria is one of the foremost
death-causing ailments in northwestern Argentina. I
would, however, class these provinces as being healthy, as
there are no other epidemics excepting an occasional
sporadic outbreak of smallpox.
</p>

<p>
Entering Tucumán province from Santiago del Estero,
the scenery abruptly changes from the quebracho thicket
to large open fields of sugar cane. It was summer when
I visited it and the cane was nowhere near its growth.
Compared with Cuba, the soil is poorer, the cane sicklier,
and the establishments smaller. It is a go-between Cuba
and the other islands of the West Indies.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105'>[105]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
From the city of Tucumán northward the scenery is
beautiful. Seated in the dining car of the narrow gauge
Central Northern Railroad with an overflowing glass of
Rubia beer in front of me, and gazing at the fleeting
landscape, I was entranced by the works of God. An
endless forest of hardwood, with magnificent spreading
tops, yet too small to make saw timber, formed an excrescence
on the reddish clay thicker than bristles on Tamworth
swine. The undergrowth is thick like that of
southern Chile, but here nature is like that of a warmer
clime. No towns and but few farmhouses are visible,
yet this is a populous country. The houses are hidden
away in the forest, and their owners make their living by
stock raising, their herds roaming at random in the woods.
High green mountains grace the landscape, their lower
reaches wooded, while their tops uplifted above the tree
line are verdant with grasses. They are like the Paraguayan
mountains in contour, domed or serrated but never
flat. The rainy season is from December to April. Then
the country looks its best. Under such conditions I saw
it. The seven months from May through November
constitute the dry season, and I was told that then the
landscape has a dreary appearance owing to its parched
dryness. The cattle seem to thrive even then. They
are gaunt, rawboned creatures and even when fat, a man
can nearly hang his hat upon their haunches. They
have great endurance and are driven across the northern
passes into Chile where they sell for nineteen cents a
pound live weight. Even with their great shrinkage en
route there is quite a profit to this. In the Province of
Salta where land cannot get irrigation, it is worthless
except for cattle raising owing to the seven months'
drought, as water is absolutely necessary for their crops.
</p>

<p>
To the stations, on the approach of the train, lean dogs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106'>[106]</a></span>
and fat sows come, and standing on the platform in front
of the dining car, they look longingly at the windows,
and with barking and squealing let their presence be
known. These animals know exactly what time the trains
are scheduled to arrive and depart, where the dining car
stops, and at which end of the dining car the kitchen is.
This sagacity comes from intuition covering a long period.
They are at every station and are especially noticeable at
the stop named Virgilio Tedin. The cook and waiters
never throw them anything, but instead occasionally
douse them with the contents of a bucket of dish water.
The passengers are more compassionate, and always
throw a piece of biscuit or bone at these animals who
pounce upon the castings with squeals of delight. The
dogs are afraid of the sows, which although fat are of good
fighting material.</p>

<p class='caption'>Güemes
</p>

<p class="caption-sub">
A typical town of northern Argentina</p>
</div>

<p>
Güemes, a town of two thousand inhabitants is the
junction for Salta and for Jujuy. Although Salta is on a
branch line and Jujuy is on the main one, all through
trains go to Salta for it is the largest place. For Jujuy,
you have to change. Jujuy, the capital of the small province
of the same name, is a miserable, squalid place of six
thousand inhabitants, in a hot but healthy valley. It used
to have twenty thousand people in the Colonial period,
when it was the outpost of Spanish civilization of the La
Plata provinces; it then did a brisk trade with Bolivia.
The town has no future. Midway between Güemes and
Jujuy is the junction of Perico from which place a railroad
extends in a northeasterly direction to Oran, in the
province of Salta. This is also an old place with many
houses in ruins. It has but twenty-five hundred inhabitants
and is a shell of its former opulence. It now has a good
future because a railroad is being built to connect it with
Formosa on the Paraguay River, and much timber and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107'>[107]</a></span>
tropical products will be brought in to be exported. Now
Oran exports oranges and bananas. Another old Colonial
town of crumbling houses is Santiago del Esteca near
Metan, a station of the Central Northern Railroad south
of Güemes. Santiago del Esteca lies in the midst of a
thick forest and communication with the outside world is
carried on over a rough wagon road. The Central Northern
Railroad ends at La Quiaca, the frontier station at
the Bolivian boundary line. From Jujuy northward it is a
gradual climb to Abrapampa, over thirteen thousand feet
above sea level and then a drop of about three thousand
feet to the terminus. The railroad is in some places
rack and pinion but the trip for scenic beauty affords but
little interest to the tourist for it is over bleak and barren
mountains. The trip from Buenos Aires to La Paz,
Bolivia, can be made in one week, owing to the excellent
stage-coach service of a Bolivian company connecting La
Quiaca with Uyuni on the Antofagasta to Bolivia Railroad.

Live hogs in northern Argentina are shipped in the
baggage cars of passenger trains, although there seems to
be plenty of empty swine wagons. The animals are
trussed up by a noose slipped over their snouts, drawn
tightly and slipped around their front feet which are
bound; the rope is then extended to their hind feet which
are already hobbled. I saw half a dozen of these creatures
bound this way being taken from the baggage car at
Güemes and laid in the sun on the depot platform,
when the thermometer stood at 108° Fahrenheit in the
shade.
</p>

<p>
On the spur to Salta the first stop is Campo Santo,
meaning "holy ground" or "cemetery." I am told that
it is very appropriately named as the fevers here are
exceedingly common and are of great virulence.
</p>

<p>
He who has been to Argentina and has failed to see the
Lerma Valley is to be pitied. I have been told that the
Cauca Valley in Colombia is one of nature's rare masterpieces,
and I would like to have it compared with that of
the Lerma by somebody who has seen both. Midway
between Güemes and Salta we reach the Lerma River,
and the high wooded hills narrow down to a defile, coming
to the water's edge in some places which necessitates the
train in some places to pass through tunnels. An occasional
charcoal burner's hut is seen, but no other habitations.
Suddenly the defile ends, the river is crossed,
and a long valley several miles wide is entered, its whole
floor in a high state of cultivation and dotted with farmhouses.
Near at hand are green foothills, which afford
pasture for stock. Behind are wooded mountains. The
whole panorama is beautified by the high Andes to the
west and north whose summits are capped with perpetual
snow. The city of Salta is approached; its many towers
and Gothic spires, together with its setting at the base of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109'>[109]</a></span>
wooded mountains, brings to one's mind visions of cities
of Central Europe.</p>

The Province of Salta has an area of 62,184 square miles
and had 185,643 inhabitants according to the last census,
that of 1914. It is divided into twenty-one departments
which are analogous to the counties of our states. There
is a great variation of soil and climate ranging from barrenness
and frigidity in the high Andes to exuberant vegetation
and torrid heats in the department of Oran. The
principal industry is the exportation of stock into Chile.
A railroad to Chile seems to be the want of the inhabitants.
They say that if one were built to Antofagasta, they would
need no trade with the rest of Argentina for then all their
exports would be sent north by the Pacific boats, and their
imports from the United States would be brought in that
way, saving a great expense in freight. This is only too
true. Argentina is willing that such a railroad should be
built, but the Chilean Government has refused permission
on the grounds that there would be a great exodus of
population from their barren northern provinces to the
fruitful country across the Andes, namely Salta and Jujuy.
There has always been more or less enmity between
Argentina and Chile over a national boundary dispute
regarding the limits of the Province of Salta, whose productive
soil the first-mentioned country is jealous of. The
question once nearly precipitated a war and the statue of
the Cristo Redentor is a monument of the pact of peace.

<p>
Whenever nature bestows opulence on a country, it
invariably endows it with setbacks. This it did in Salta
by giving it fevers and venomous snakes. The chuchu
fever is the commonest disease and although not so prevalent
as in the Province of Tucumán, it is here in a more
malignant form. It is conveyed by the bite of the mosquito
and much resembles ague, excepting that the body is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111'>[111]</a></span>
racked by pains, each day in a different place. It is
supposed never to leave the system, quinine availing but
little. It weakens the heart and in this way death is
caused, but only after several or more years. Some people
never have it, and, by the healthy looks of the inhabitants
and by the number of aged people to be seen in Salta, I do
not believe its effects are as dangerous as is claimed.
Among the snake family there are some venomous species,
notably the viper and the cascabel. The bite of the latter
is synonymous with sure death.
</p>

<p>
The city of Salta, whose population is estimated at
twenty-eight thousand exclusive of a garrison of two
thousand soldiers, is one of the best built cities and,
for its size, one of the liveliest towns in Argentina. Its
streets are paved with creosote blocks as in Paris; it
has an electric car system and all the progressive improvements.
Its buildings are modern two-story structures,
and old houses of the Colonial period with ornate carved
wood entrances. On February 20, 1813, General Arenales
defeated the Spaniards on a plain north of the town, and a
few years ago at a Centennial to celebrate the event, a
handsome monument of stone with bronze martial bas-reliefs,
surmounted by a female statue of Liberty holding
aloft a cross, was unveiled on the battle ground and is
regarded by the Saltenos as the pride of their town. The
principal plaza of the city is named in honor of the hero,
Arenales, and a monument is soon to be placed on the
brick base in the center of this square which formerly was
graced by a squat obelisk. The principal club of the city
is likewise named after the victory, its nomenclature being
the 20th of February Club. This edifice faces the plaza
and is by far the most modern building in Salta; it is the
only building in the city that is three stories high. Many
cities of half a million inhabitants cannot boast of so fine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112'>[112]</a></span>
a club regarding interior furnishings. The wood carving,
which is of Salta oak and cedar is of native workmanship;
the Saltenos are famous in that art and I doubt if anywhere
woodcarving by hand is done better. The parquet
flooring of the club ballroom makes the visitor gasp with
amazement when he is told that the work and the wood are
all local. On the furniture of this club, which is even
equipped with a gymnasium, no expense has been spared.
The ballroom chairs of Marie Antoinette style are upholstered
with silk, and the massive candelabra are of the
choicest Venetian glass. The toilet room, I am pleased to
relate, is one of the very few that I visited in Argentina
that is kept clean.
</p>

<p>
The buildings around the Plaza Arenales are all arcaded,
but the only one of architectural interest is the old Cabildo,
or city hall, of Spanish times. It is a low, squat, long
structure of massive walls and with rounded arches forming
the arcades. A low, pointed tower rises above the
center. The lower floor of this building is now given up
entirely to stores while the upper ones are leased for
dwelling purposes.</p>

<p>
The Hotel Plaza of Ramon Terres is a two-story building
at the northeast corner of the square and, although it
is by no means a St. Regis, it is good enough for Salta.
Unfortunately most of the bedrooms face a glass-roofed
courtyard, which besides making them dark, does not
allow the entry of much fresh air. The pillows are so hard
that the guests are apt to wonder if they are stuffed with
brickbats. One of the curious figures that haunted the
hotel café was a very old, tall, and thin gentleman of a
decidedly noble and dignified appearance. His hair which
was abundant, and his well-trimmed beard were silvery
white. His clean features, neat black clothes, and derby
hat would deceive a person into believing that this old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113'>[113]</a></span>
man was a retired Scots professor or German scientist.
There was something uncanny about his appearance, for
I had never before seen so well-groomed and active a man
of an age that I imagined him to be; it was as if he had long
ago passed the age limit in which old men die, and yet
decided that he would remain on earth a good spell yet.
He was always one of the last persons to leave the cafés
nights, and the first to enter them mornings; he made the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114'>[114]</a></span>
rounds with regularity, and always had a drink before
him. I asked the Spanish bartender who he was:
</p>

<p>
"He was once a very rich man who made his money by
cattle dealing in Chile. He spent most of it and now is
on an allowance from his relations. He has been in Chile
over one hundred times trading stock, and is thinking of
going again soon. He is an expert horseman. He is over
one hundred years old, and," said the waiter in a confidential
undertone, "he is a devil with the women. He
chases after all the servant girls and has lewd designs on
the chambermaid." This chambermaid, by the way, was
terribly good-looking, with dark brown eyes, and rosy red
cheeks. I admired the old man's choice.
</p>

<p>
Salta has some remarkable religious edifices. It is the
see of a bishop, who has a palace adjoining the cathedral.
The diocese was created in 1806 and comprises the provinces
of Salta and Jujuy. The present bishop, José
Gregorio Romero, has been the incumbent only since 1915.
The inhabitants have the reputation of being very devout,
although I observed that all the Catholics with whom I
was brought into contact with in Salta, ate meat on
Friday. This also applies to the clergy. In the rich, cool,
and lofty cathedral, there is a shrine with an image of
the crucified Savior, which has a most peculiar history.
Years ago there was found on a lonely beach in Chile, two
boxes, which had evidently been washed ashore from an
unknown shipwreck. One was labeled with the address
of a person in Córdoba, and the other was addressed to a
Señor del Milagro in Salta. On being opened, the box
destined for Córdoba was found to contain an image of the
Virgin, while that for Salta contained the Christ. His halo
is of wrought gold, and the cross on which He is nailed is of
iron. As there was no such person in Salta as "del
Milagro," the church appropriated the image which is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115'>[115]</a></span>
known as the Cristo del Milagro, and is shown by the
sexton.
</p>

<p>
Two of the oldest churches are those of Merced and of
San Bernardo. The church of the Candelaria has the
finest façade with a detached campanile, but the most
interesting of all is the church and monastery of San
Francisco. The cloister has massive walls, seven feet
thick. It houses fourteen brown-robed monks of the
Franciscan order. Most of them were an unwashed,
unkempt lot; the quantity of empty wine and beer bottles
in the kitchen yard bore testimony to many libations on
their part. The whole monastery is a maze of halls,
porches, passageways, staircases, cupolas, belfries, cells,
courtyards, and gardens. This confusion arose because a
new part was added each time the growth of the monastery
warranted it. Into the large garden is turned nightly a
large bloodhound, kept ugly by being constantly fed on
raw meat. This is to prevent the townspeople from scaling
the walls to steal the luscious fruit and grapes which
the monks cultivate. In the daytime the dog is kept
chained up, but only two or three of the inmates are on
friendly enough terms with this modern Cerberus to
approach it. The tall campanile of San Francisco is the
highest church tower in Argentina.</p>

I had a letter of introduction from Dr. Manuel de
Iriondo, president of the Bank of the Argentine Nation
and one of the most prominent men in the republic, to the
manager of the Salta branch, Señor Francisco Pereyra.
I have never met a finer gentleman that Señor Pereyra.
Not only did he wine and dine me at his own residence,
but he went at great length to entertain me, introduce me
to his friends, to the mayor of the city, to the governor of
the province, took me out for automobile rides, and when
I left Salta loaded me with literature, both statistical
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116'>[116]</a></span>
and historical of the province and city. Señor Pereyra
made me a present of a hardwood cane, the tree from which
it is made being indigenous to the Province of Salta, and
named San Antonio. Mariano Posse is the name of
Pereyra's eighteen-year-old brother-in-law who is going
to Buenos Aires in a year to study medicine. I tried to
persuade the young man to come to the United States to
take a course in one of our universities, which I think will
eventually materialize. At the time of this writing, Señor
Pereyra has left Salta and is manager of the Bank of the
Argentine Nation at Catamarca, the capital of the Andean
province of the same name. He had recently, shortly
before leaving Salta, the misfortune to lose by death, his
wife, an estimable lady. I met Dr. Waldino Riarte, a
friend of Señor Pereyra's. Both men were originally from
Tucumán. Dr. Riarte is one of the wealthiest and highest
standing men in the province, to which position he rose
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117'>[117]</a></span>
through his own efforts. One of the Salteno's with whom
I became acquainted was Dr. Sola, a graduate of the Ohio
State University, class of 1904. He has not been in the
United States since he graduated. He was sent there to
study, by the Argentine Government, and liked it so well
that he wants to go back to the United States. He was
anxious to hear the results of the collegiate football games
for the past few years, as he played on the 'varsity while
attending Ohio State.
</p>

<p>
"Chopp" (pronounced <i>schop</i>) is a coined word supposed
to be the Spanish translation of the German word <i>schoppen</i>.
Its nearest English equivalent is our coined word "schuper."
Under the arcades of the old Cabildo, a German has
established a saloon which he has named "El Bueno
Chopp," meaning "The Good Schuper." A native seeing
the volume of business which came to the thrifty German,
thinking that it all came from the name he gave his place,
hung out a sign styling his liquid refreshment emporium,
"El Mejor Chopp," which means "The Best Schuper."
It happens that in this latter resort, it is impossible to get
draught beer in schupers, as the proprietor deals only in
bottled goods. He does a poor business compared to that
of the German.
</p>

<p>
In the Bueno Chopp saloon where I would occasionally
go for a libation, I met a Dantziger named Holzmann.
He inquired of me the names of the North American magazines
most widely read by the higher classes of women,
whereupon I told him the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, Harper's
<i>Bazaar</i>, and others, giving him their addresses. He later
confided to me that the reason for his asking was that he
wished through their columns to make an announcement
that he intended to get married and he wanted a North
American woman for his wife. He said he had taken a
passion for women of that nationality, and would accept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118'>[118]</a></span>
no others. This passion, I found, had developed from his
having become enamored of the photograph of one of
our well-known society queens that is frequently flaunted
before our eyes in the newspaper columns of the Sunday
supplements. Holzmann told me that when he resided in
East Africa, he occasionally gave his former wife, when
she was unruly, a beating with a hippopotamus hide whip;
so I see what sort of fate is in store for his American bride.

Salta years ago had a brewery owned by a man named
Glueck. Through mismanagement it failed. The city
has 120 automobiles which speaks well for a town of its size
and isolation in South America. The wine grown there is
supposed to be the best in Argentina, although there has
been little done towards putting it on the market.
</p>

<p>
While I was a guest of the Pereyras' I witnessed a novel
sight. After dinner a bat was turned loose in the dining
room. This phyllostome Señor Pereyra kept in a large
cage and occasionally turned it loose to eat the mosquitoes
which are a curse to Salta.

<p>
Midway between Salta and Tucumán is the station of
Rosario de la Frontera near which are some famous mineral
baths. It is quite a winter resort and its waters are
bottled and sold all over the republic. Palau is the name
of the most widely distributed brand. These waters are
naturally carbonated, but are not as strong as Apollinaris
or White Rock. One of the finest waters in Argentina is
that of Ghino from Tucumán province. It is somewhat
like Vichy in taste but is slightly medicated. Its sale,
however, is unfortunately local.
</p>

<p>
The Province of Tucumán derives its name from a
legendary Indian cacique named Tucuma, who is supposed
to have lived in the plain of the Rio Monteros which flows
through the province and which joins the Rio Salí near the
city of Tucumán. It is the smallest province of Argentina,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119'>[119]</a></span>
having an area of only 8926 square miles. Three-quarters
of its surface is level, the remaining quarter which is the
western part being hilly and mountainous. Tucumán
is the most densely settled portion of Argentina, its population
being, according to the census of 1914, 373,073. On
account of this density of population the Tucumános like
to call their province "The Europe of Argentina." In
most of the republic the railroads preceded the settlers;
here and also in Salta this is the reverse, for the settlers
in these provinces came first. In 1560 the Viceroy of Peru,
to whose dominions this part of the country had belonged,
declared Tucumán an independent state. It then comprised
what are now the geographical divisions of Santiago
del Estero, Tucumán, Catamarca, Salta, Jujuy, and Córdoba.
In 1782 Salta, Jujuy, and Córdoba were separated
from it. In 1821 Catamarca and Santiago del Estero followed
suit.
</p>

<p>
The capital city, also named Tucumán, was founded
September 29, 1565, by Diego de Villarroel at the confluence
of the Salí and Monteros rivers. In 1585 it was
moved to the site that it now occupies. It is situated
near the middle of the province, at an elevation of 1453
feet above sea level. The city itself has a population of
about one hundred thousand inhabitants, but it is a distributing
point for a much greater population for at no
great distance from it are numerous towns, large sugar
factories with their colonies of workmen. In shape the
city is nearly square. It is eighteen blocks long from north
to south and fourteen blocks wide from east to west. The
streets are wide, and the newer ones, especially the boulevards
which bound the limits, are lined with trees, sycamores
being in the majority. Four blocks west of the
eastern city limits is the Plaza Independencia, the center
of mercantile, religious, and diverting activity. On it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120'>[120]</a></span>
stands the cathedral, another church, the capitol, at
least ten large cafés, and a couple of moving picture shows,
while in the neighborhood on a street named Las Heras
are the best shops.
</p>

<p>
Las Heras, an east and west intersector, is the main
business street, although the one which parallels it one
block to the south, and which is named Calle 24 de Setiembre,
is the street which divides its intersectors into
different nomenclatures in the manner of the Calle Rivadavia
in Buenos Aires. South of Calle 24 de Setiembre,
the streets that cross it have different names than the
elongations of them that run north of it. On Calle Las
Heras are the important banks. The next business streets
in order according to their commercial worth are Mendoza,
which parallels Las Heras one block north of it, Laprida,
and Maipu, the two last named being cross streets. Calle
Maipu is devoted to second class-shops; the third-class
shops and the slums, which are vile, although not so
vile as the slums of Córdoba, are at the extreme western
end of Las Heras near the Central of Córdoba Railroad
station.
</p>

<p>
The religious edifices, although their external appearances
are imposing and have double towers and domes of
light blue porcelain tile, are not worth visiting unless to
pray in, as their interiors offer no more artistic attractions
than thousands of their kind elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The capitol is by far the finest building in the city. It is
three stories high on the outside, and four on the inside
(for the courtyards are sunk one story below the street
level), and occupies a considerable area. It is by no means
the finest capitol building that I have visited, but as it is
the newest, having been just completed, it is probably the
best equipped. Though it is built in the business section
of the city where it cannot show off to its best advantage,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121'>[121]</a></span>
it however, makes the capitol at Lansing, Michigan, look
like 30 cents. In Argentine, as it is almost impossible
to get marble, all the provincial capitols are built of brick,
solidly, so as to stand forever. The Argentine brick is
not pleasing to the eyes, as it is rough. To embellish the
buildings of this material they are given a coating of drab
stucco cement.</p>

</div>

<p>
I visited the Governor, Dr. Ernesto Padilla, a tall,
handsome, affable man about forty years old. He is quite
an archeologist, and in a room adjoining his private office
in the capitol he has installed his private collection of
Indian antiquities of the province. It is a most remarkable
collection of pottery, ornaments, etc. Near Tafí a
large stone has been recently discovered with Indian
scrolls, hieroglyphics, and drawings. A North American
photographer residing in Tucumán went out to see this
stone. With chalk, he outlined the rather indistinct
drawings and then took a photograph of it. This photograph
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122'>[122]</a></span>
is reproduced on pages 635 and 637 of my previous
work, <i>Illustrated, Descriptive Argentina</i>.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Padilla introduced me to General O'Donnell, the
military commander of the province. A curious fact is
that this general cannot speak the English language, having
been born in Argentina. I held a letter of introduction
to Señor S. A. Wyss, manager of the Hilaret y Cia
sugar mill at Santa Ana, the largest in South America, and
also one to Mr. Stewart Shipton, manager of the Corona
mill at Concepción. Both mills are several hours' distant
from Tucumán, and in trying to catch the train for Concepción,
I went to the wrong depot. Dr. Padilla afterwards
told me that it would have been useless for me to have
gone to either of those places, because there were sugar
mills much nearer to the city. He wrote me a letter of
introduction to Señor Alfredo Guzman, the richest man in
the province, who has a mill at a town also named Concepción,
which is only a twenty minutes' drive from the capital.
He likewise wrote me a letter to Dr. Juan C. Nougués,
who has a mill at San Pablo, which I visited. There are
two kinds of sugar districts in the Province of Tucumán,
one on the plains like that of Señor Guzman's estate, and
one in the hills like the one at San Pablo.
</p>

<p>
Tucumán is a hot place, both climatically and morally.
In the latter line are the Crystal Palace and the Moulin
Rouge, while in the former line, the thermometer often
rises above the comfortable point. The night I arrived
it registered 106° Fahrenheit in the shade. It was so hot
that I thought I would cool off by walking down the
Calle Laprida. The one-story houses are so constructed
that in front of each window an iron balcony extends to the
sidewalk; the railings of these are of wrought iron, or
marble. Here sit the belles on hot summer nights airing
themselves. They certainly need to, for as I strolled down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123'>[123]</a></span>
the street the stench that was wafted from them to me
was nearly asphyxiating. It is the odor that is present in
the summer when the human body is unfriendly to soap,
water, and the scrub brush. Some of these beauties sat
behind shutters in the darkness, but I was aware of their
presence, although I could not see them.</p>

<p>
In 1914, there was founded in Tucumán a university,
at the head of which is Dr. Juan B. Teran. So far, the
university is incomplete, for of the five departments of
instruction which it will have when completed, only two
are at present running. These are the pedagogical
department, and that of mechanics, agriculture, and
chemistry. The latter has an agricultural experimental
station near the city, at present in charge of a North
American, Dr. William E. Cross. Its chemical and
bacteriological laboratory is the best in the republic.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124'>[124]</a></span>
The University of Tucumán to-day is more like a polytechnical
institute and agricultural combined than that
which we generally think of by the word "university."
</p>

<p>
As to hotels, Tucumán has one of the best in South
America, the Savoy. It, together with two separate
buildings, one a roulette casino, and the other a large
theater, is the property of the Da Rossa Company, a
Portuguese syndicate. The Savoy is leased to a Frenchman,
R. Eluchand, and is managed by Señor Scheindl formerly
of Vienna. It is Mr. Scheindl's sister whose portrait
appears on the Austrian twenty crown note; she was supposed
to be the most beautiful girl in Austria. The Savoy
is a large affair of 116 rooms, most of which have a bath in
connection. It is on the Boulevard Sarmiento in an excellent
but not central location. It is finely equipped, and is
like a palace with its large courtyard enclosed by pillared
balconies. The hotel has been a "white elephant"
because it is too fine for the city. Mr. Scheindl tells me
that in the hotel line, the Tucumános always want something
for nothing, and when the inhabitants give their big
balls at the Savoy, he either runs behind or else only
breaks even; otherwise, if he insisted that they pay what
he thought would be just, they would boycott him in the
future. The other hotels which are in the central part of
the city are the Europe, the Paris, and the Frascati, the
first mentioned being the best. The Frascati is owned by
the Palladini brothers, one of them, Attilio, having been
former manager of the Savoy. When I knew Attilio
Palladini several years ago, he was the courier of the
Parque Hotel in Montevideo, and quit it to be head portier
of the Hotel Savoy in Buenos Aires.
</p>

<p>
In Tucumán itself, there is nothing of interest for the
sightseer. It is only a large commercial town in a fine
agricultural district dependent on the sugar industry.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125'>[125]</a></span>
Contrary to the fabrications the stranger will hear elsewhere
in Argentina knocking it, saying that it is a fever
hotbed, it is a sanitary place for the person that has the
price to indulge in mineral waters as beverages, for its own
water is not potable, owing to the sediment and dust that
it contains. Talking with business men about investment
of capital in Tucumán, there does not seem to be much
encouragement in the manufacturing line. A flour mill
would undoubtedly pay, and there is a splendid opportunity
to start a steam laundry, as there is a constant complaint
about the present one. It does its work poorly and
charges exorbitant prices. It is said that a small ice plant
in one of the neighboring towns, which would supply the
wants of the inhabitants of the thickly inhabited districts,
would also pay. A brewery has started in Tucumán,
named the Cerveceria del Norte (Northern Brewery). It
is controlled by the Quilmes people and has a large enough
capacity to supply entire Argentina if necessary. Its
brands of beer from light to dark are Rubia, Tucma, and
Oran. Rubia is very palatable.
</p>

<p>
I became acquainted with a photographer in Tucumán,
Mr. Henry A. Kirwin of New York. He came down here
as a photographer eight years ago, and wants to get back
home. He says it is much easier for a man to get down
there than to get back. He seems to have a fair business,
photographing machinery at the different mills and at the
railroad yards at Tafí Viejo. Many of his photographs of
family groups have yellow chemicals smeared over the faces
of the clients on the plates. I asked him why this was.
</p>

<p>
"You see," said he, "most of the natives have Indian
blood. It is supposed to be much nicer if this origin
would be unknown, therefore I have to put this chemical
on the plates so their faces will have a decidedly European
cast in the photograph."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126'>[126]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is customary for the relatives of dead persons to have
photographs taken of their once beloved. Mr. Kirwin had
a choice collection of these local corpses which he insisted
on showing me; there were over sixty. Among them were
some "tasty" specimens, some being victims of the bubonic
plague in 1913. Some were unrecognizable, charred
masses of flesh that had been human before the subjects
perished in a fire, while others were the gruesome countenances
of cadavers whose faces were partially eaten away
by cancer.
</p>

<p>
While in Mendoza, I thought the canine population was
excessive. It is small compared with that of Tucumán.
In this city every criolla has two or more Mexican hairless
dogs, and the number of hybrids between bulldog, Great
Dane, whiffet, and old hound is appalling. Three hundred
thousand dogs is, I think, a low estimate of the
canine inhabitants of the city. None are muzzled; but
few are fed; and all run after bicycles, automobiles, and
wagons. They make night hideous by howling, and
fighting about the possession of putrid bones, mule dung,
and garbage.
</p>

<p>
From Tucumán there is a trip that the visitor should
not fail to miss. This is the twenty-mile automobile ride
to the settlement and summer resort of Villa Nougués,
4225 feet above the plain on which the city is built.
Nougués is situated not far from the summit of the wooded
mountains southwest of Tucumán. The road leads due
west, and then swerves to the south past populous farming
country and through the village of Yerba Buena to the
sugar mill and colony of San Pablo, where Dr. Nougués has
his palatial mansion, and private church. His beautiful
estate lies on gently sloping ground two miles east of the
wooded mountains. All provisions for the summer
colony and hotel at Villa Nougués must be taken up by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127'>[127]</a></span>
wagon or by automobile from Tucumán. Most of the
heavy trucking is done by means of ox carts. Early in the
morning we met at San Pablo several of these oxcarts
plodding slowly up the country road, and at night on our
return to the city we met these same teams only halfway
up the mountain, so hard is the pull on the beasts.
When the road reaches the mountains it makes a serpentine,
and then zigzags upward through the semi-tropical
forest abounding with orange and crimson cannas. Every
so often through the umbrageous trees and giant ferns, a
panorama is to be had of the plain of Tucumán with its
rectangular fields of sugar cane and small towns with their
<i>usines</i>.</p>

<p>
Arrived at the settlement of Villa Nougués is the hotel
where parties from the city come up on hot days to enjoy
the cool invigorating air. Seated on the porch of Dr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128'>[128]</a></span>
Teran's house, which is near the hotel, in company of Dr.
Teran, Governor Padilla, Señor Scheindl, and a rich sugar
planter named Rouges, we looked across the broad long
plain, styled the "Europe of Argentina," and I learned
many interesting facts. The valley of the Rio Salí which
crosses the province from north to south, is fed by twenty-five
rivers which flow into it from the west to the east.
The Salí flows southward and is finally lost in a large
brackish lake, the Mar Chiquita in the Province of Córdoba.
The great industrial and agricultural plain, with its
sugar mills among which are the usines of San José, San
Antonio, San Pablo, Paraiso, and countless others and its
railroad workshops at Tafí Viejo, has a cultivated area of
two hundred and fifty thousand acres. It was originally
thickly forested as can be testified by occasional uncleared
patches. Here civilization preceded the railroad, and only
in the poorer part of the province in the direction of
Santiago del Estero did the railroad come first. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129'>[129]</a></span>
valley is the cradle of Argentine liberty, for here the
Spaniards having gone through the country like a steam
mower, were finally decisively beaten in battle, and July
9, 1816, at Tucumán, the Argentine Confederation was
born.
</p>

<p>
Three kilometers west of Villa Nougués is the summit
of the foothills. Looking west from this summit, the vista
of the San Javier Valley, with its forested mountains,
and with its wooded detached hills rising from the midst
of cultivated river bottoms, Alpine pastures, and numerous
streams, is like that of the Inn in Tirol, although it is here
even more beautiful. The Catamarca mountains, snow-capped
domed Aconquija, and the bleak Andes form the
western background, behind which the sun sinks in the
aureate splendor of a fireball. This is one of the finest
views in the world and should be seen in the late afternoon.

<h2>
CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="s08">CÓRDOBA</span>
</h2>

<p>
Córdoba is the third province of Argentina in population,
it having had in 1914, 732,727 inhabitants. In
area it contains 62,160 square miles. It is the heart of
Argentina, being situated in the center of the republic.
The eastern part is pampa while the western part is a
high, dry plateau, traversed from north to south by
mountain ranges notably among which are chains of
Pocho and Ischilin. These mountain ranges which are
two hundred miles in length are isolated from the Andean
system; their southernmost extremities are named the
Sierra de Córdoba and are a veritable karst like the
Kuestenlande of Austria, gray granite boulders being
everywhere. The eastern slopes of this karst are covered
with a thick vegetation of mesquite and other shrubs due
to the moist Atlantic winds, while their western slopes are
destitute of vegetation. The air here is dry and refreshing
and the Sierra de Córdoba enjoys the same rôle in Argentina
that Colorado does in the United States, being the haunt
of consumptives. Likewise the Sierra is the playground
of many wealthy Buenos Aires families, for it is a treat to
them to get away from the level monotonous plain upon
which their city is built. West and northwest of the
isolated mountain chain is a vast barren desert, part of it
being called the Salinas Grandes on account of the white
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131'>[131]</a></span>
surface of the soil due to saline deposits. Córdoba is
watered by five rivers named the Primero, Segundo,
Tercero, Quarto, and Quinto (which means First, Second,
Third, Fourth, and Fifth). These rivers are used for irrigating
purposes, for water power, and for electricity. The
whole province is noted for the pureness of its well water,
artesian wells abounding. Every few years the locust or
grasshopper plague hits Argentina, and when it comes it
strikes Córdoba unusually hard. One of the frontispiece
photographs shows a locust trap on a Córdoba farm.
This is the catch of two days, the corrugated iron plates
having been spread with honey mixed with poison. I
consider this one of the most remarkable photographs ever
published.
</p>

<p>
The trip from Tucumán to Córdoba is an 11 hours' trip
of 340 miles by the Central of Córdoba Railroad. The
track is narrow gauge, but the sleepers, dining car, and
service are the best that I have ever chanced on in Argentina.
All trains between the two cities make the trip by
night, for in the daytime the heat and glare of the sun on
the Salinas Grandes, a great salt desert midway between
the two cities, is unbearable. This desert abounds with
rattlesnakes, called "cascabel." I met a tramp who
walked from Tucumán to Córdoba; he was afraid to lie
down by the wayside to rest on account of these reptiles.
In one day he killed over fifty of them.
</p>

<p>
The first eighty miles of the journey crosses about as
pleasant a country as can be found anywhere, passing
through the cities of Bella Vista, La Madrid, and San
Pedro. At the latter place, the first town in the Province
of Catamarca, desolation begins and continues until daylight
the next morning when the traveler awakes at the
large town of Dean Funes, the junction for San Juan,
capital of the province of the same name. Low rocky
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132'>[132]</a></span>
hills now rise in every direction; the soil, dry, parched, and
somewhat stony is overrun with pampa grass. It is cool
and a wind is invariably blowing. The nature of the
country continues this way almost to Córdoba, although
before reaching that city, the hills to the southwest take
the form and acquire the height of mountains.
</p>

<p>
Córdoba, the third city of Argentina, has a population,
exclusive of its suburbs, of one hundred and sixty thousand
inhabitants. It was founded in 1573 by Luis Geronimo
de Cabrera, and has always been noted as a seat of learning
and of religion. Its university, which vies with that of
San Marcos in Lima in being the oldest in the Western
Hemisphere, was founded June 19, 1613, by a Jesuit father,
Fernando de Trejo y Sanabria. The first printing press
in Argentina was brought to this university from Lima
in 1765. Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia, Paraguay's able
dictator, was a graduate of Córdoba's university. The
churches, cloisters, convents, and religious institutions of
the city are innumerable, and it is estimated that over
six thousand of its inhabitants are connected with the
religious orders and organizations. Córdoba is one of the
cleanest cities in America, and it is difficult to find a place
where civic pride, park system, cleanliness of house exteriors,
public buildings, pavement, hotels, cafés, department
stores, banks, residences, religious edifices, and water
supply taken as a whole can equal that of it. Many
cities may excel it in one or two of the above mentioned
institutions but not in the majority. Personally I would
not care to live there unless engaged in some business, as
there are too many "lungers," and the surrounding country
is but a dry and rocky karst; the diversion of street
life would soon become irksome, for with the exception of
cafés, moving picture shows, theaters, and an occasional
horse race, no Argentine city possesses any real live amusement
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133'>[133]</a></span>
places, excepting those that are synonymous with
lights seen through carmine transoms, and they happily
are not in my line.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i158" id="i158"></a>
<img src="images/i-158.jpg" width="550" height="396" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Northern Market, Córdoba</p>
</div>

<p>
I can see no reason for Córdoba's existence and growth.
The soil of the country is poor and rocky, while the rainfall
is slight. In the year 1915, seven months elapsed without
a drop falling. The city is situated to the west of the
productive part of the province, and from it westward to
San Juan at the foot of the Andes, the country is the
poorest in the republic. Yet Córdoba has had a rapid
growth recently. In the manufacturing line, it has three
breweries, that of Pollak and Brueck, generally called the
Córdoba Brewery; that of the Ahrens, and the main brewery
of the Rio Segundo Company. There is a large flour
mill owned by Minetti, an Italian, and several brickyards.
Here are also located the shops of the Central of Córdoba
Railroad.
</p>

<p>
The chief industry of Córdoba is brewing, this being
largely due to the remarkable pureness of its well water
which is artesian. Señor Nicolas J. Oderigo, manager of
the bank of the Argentine nation, wrote me a letter of
introduction to Mr. C. Davis, president of the Rio Segundo
Brewing Company, which I visited in the company of Señor
Stange, an employee of Oderigo's bank, and whom he had
the kindness to send with me to accompany me. This
large brewery has a branch at the town of Rio Segundo,
which was the original brewery. The Rio II. Brewery is
an independent brewery, not being allied to the Quilmes
outfit as is generally supposed. Mr. Davis received me
courteously and after having shown me the establishment
invited Stange and myself to his house where he entertained
us at dinner. Señor Stange is either a German or of
German descent, but when I asked him about it he denied
it, and also told me he could not speak a word of that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135'>[135]</a></span>
language. A day or two later I passed by him while he
was seated in animated conversation in a café with two
other men, and the language he was conversing in was
German. As Mr. Davis is an Englishman, Stange evidently
had private reasons to cover his nationality. The
brewmaster of the Rio II. Brewery told me that brewing
was not a profitable industry in Argentina, because the
Quilmes company was a trust and its members being
affiliated with the political party that is in power, it has
the capital and the means to drive the smaller breweries to
the wall, by stringent legislation and usurious taxation.
This Rio II. Brewery is smaller than the large breweries
of Detroit, yet it pays more taxes than does the Anheuser-Busch
Brewery or the Pabst or Schlitz breweries.
</p>

<p>
The Córdoba Brewery as I have mentioned is owned by
Pollak and Brueck. Pollak is an Austrian Jew who married
a Córdoba woman, and who turned Roman Catholic
to get prestige, but like most people who are members of
the race he abjured, his business methods are not considered
synonymous with good faith.
</p>

<p>
His beer, to my idea, is the most palatable of any of the
Córdobese beers. Amber is the name of his light product,
while Muenchen is that of his dark. With the townspeople
his product is the most popular, notwithstanding
his personal unpopularity.
</p>

<p>
The approach to Córdoba by rail is similar on a small
scale to that of La Paz, Bolivia, for both cities lie in a
pocket in the hills and their presence is not visible until
the ground of the plain above them drops away, and they
are seen below you. The pocket which contains La Paz
is ten times deeper, the surprise of the traveler on first
viewing the city being that of astonishment; but here in
Córdoba, although the scale is exceedingly miniature, the
conditions are analogous. The growth of Córdoba has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136'>[136]</a></span>
been such that there is no more room left for building in
the pocket, so now the new resident who wishes to build a
home of his own is obliged to do so on the plain above the
city. Several suburbs have sprung up and go by the names
of Alta Córdoba, Alberdi, and Nueva Córdoba.
</p>

<p>
Alta Córdoba can be likened to the station Alto de La
Paz, although here there is quite a large town. Here is
situated the Central of Córdoba railroad station with the
railroad workshops, and a market named Mercado del
Norte. A fine, broad avenue winds from Alta Córdoba in
big curves, down a cleft in the hillside, passes under a
stone railroad bridge, and reaches the river bottom at the
beautiful shady park of Las Heras. It now crosses the
Rio Primero over a new stone bridge, named the Centenario,
at whose end is the Avenue General Paz. This is
where begins the city proper, which on the floor of the
valley is twenty-one blocks wide by thirty-one blocks
long, and which does not include the other suburbs in the
pocket which are named San Vicente at the eastern and
Villa Paez at the western ends of the original town.
</p>

<p>
The Plaza San Martin is in the center of Córdoba and is
the nucleus of the city life. From here run straight streets
east and west, and north and south which are the busy
ones of the capital. On the plaza is the cathedral, two
of the leading banks, and the best hotels. The business
arrangement of this particular section is like that of
Tucumán. The great show street is the aristocratic and
superbly beautiful Avenida General Paz, beginning at the
plaza of the same name at the Centenario Bridge and
continuing ten blocks southward to the Plaza Velez
Sarsfield. This street is the handsomest in Argentina.
From the Plaza Velez Sarsfield there is a continuation of
it to the heights beyond the city proper, and which is here
named the Avenida Velez Sarsfield.

From the Plaza Velez Sarsfield the new Avenida Argentina,
destined to become the most exclusive residential
street of the city on account of the high price of the terrain,
ascends to the plazas Centenario and Dean Funes at
the entrance of Sormiento Park, Córdoba's playground.
Halfway up the Avenida Argentina on the left-hand side
stands a magnificent and imposing mansion, that of
Señor Martin Ferreyra. It is a landmark, and seen from
the plain at the opposite end of the city, it looms up as if
it dominates over the city and no other building seems as
large. It has already cost its owner over three million
pesos ($1,281,000) and is not yet completed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138'>[138]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"How did Señor Ferreyra make his money?" I asked the
chauffeur.
</p>

<p>
"His father left a large sum of money which had been
handed down from several generations. Martin Ferreyra
was made administrator of his father's estate and cheated
the other heirs out of their share," was his answer.</p>

The zoölogical garden at the Parque Sarmiento lies
in a cleft of the ridge and was laid out in 1914 by a German
engineer. It is open to the public Thursdays and
Sundays and is entered by descending in a funicular or by
a circuitous way on foot. Although it is planned to house
many animals, the only large mammals there at present
are some seals which sport beneath the spray of an artificial
cascade, and a pair of lions which a Montevideo
gentleman presented to an ex-governor of Córdoba, who
has loaned them to the city, probably at the expense of the
latter.</p>

the Protestants"; Córdoba is nicknamed "Rome of
Argentina" on account of its numerous churches, convents,
monasteries, other religious institutions, and multitude of
priests. There are several thousand of the latter body of
men; they and the soldiers are not reckoned in the national
census of urban population for they are constantly moving
from place to place. There are fourteen large churches
including the cathedral, and sixteen other Catholic Houses
of God which would be considered large in the United
States, but which are here classed as mediocre. In contrast
with the churches of all the rest of South America,
excepting those of Brazil, those of Northern Argentina are
much more beautiful with their splendid façades, domes,
and towers, the latter being roofed with variegated porcelain
tiles; blues predominating. Córdoba, Tucumán, and
Salta are especially rich in the appearance of their churches,
Tucumán taking the lead in the ornateness of the tiles.
In Córdoba are the large churches of Merced, Jesuit
Fathers, and Santo Domingo, but by far the largest and
finest church in all Argentina is the cathedral, three centuries
old, its architecture being that of the current Spanish
style that was in vogue at the time it was built. There are
a few cathedrals in America larger, those of Montreal,
Mexico City, Lima, New York, Santiago, Bahia, Montevideo,
and Rio de Janeiro in order of their size, but none
excel that of Córdoba in proud richness.
</p>

<p>
It is one of the finest churches in America with the best
mural paintings of any. In this latter respect it is only
exceeded by those of Italy. Its towers and dome are not
tiled, as that art was copied from the Portuguese and
Brazilians only during the last century. Decadent
Romanesque, it has a solemn dignity of its own.</p>

<p>
Of the hotels, the Plaza is the best. It is on the northeast
corner of the Plaza San Martin, and is new. It is a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141'>[141]</a></span>
solid four-story structure, with good rooms, and is well
furnished but poorly managed. There is a sunparlor on
the second floor. The manager told me that most of the
rooms have baths in connection, but in this he lied. I do
not believe that any of the rooms have a private bath.
This same manager, an Engadine Swiss, was formerly the
head portier of the Hotel Savoy in Rosario. I knew him
of old, and crookedness is, with him, second nature. The
restaurant of the Plaza Hotel is the best in the city. It is
on the ground floor and has a street entrance; in connection
with it is a café and a confectionery store. The meals are
<i>à la carte</i>, but I understand that people staying at the
Plaza for any length of time may get <i>pension</i>. The café
is a large one, on the Viennese style, and connects with
the restaurant by a passageway under a platform on top
of which are stationed the orchestra, so that the musical
wants of both the eaters and drinkers can be satisfied at
the same time. The bar is on the United States style,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142'>[142]</a></span>
and as is seldom the case in South America and not frequent
enough in North America, the back bar is deep
enough to give the bartenders working space, and allows
them enough room to reach for a bottle without getting
into each other's way.</p>

<p class='caption'>Corner of Plaza San Martin, Córdoba</p>
</div>

<p>
Across Calle San Geronimo from the Hotel Plaza is the
Hotel San Martin, a good house, and managed by the
former manager of the Plaza. This manager holds the
unenviable reputation of cheating his foreign help. In
Argentina, a native or a naturalized citizen always wins
out in a lawsuit. When I asked some of the ex-employees
of the San Martin why they did not sue the manager for
their back wages which they claimed were deliberately
withheld, they said:
</p>

<p>
"We would look fine as Spaniards and Austrians going
up against an Argentino in court here. The manager
would trump up some lie, and have us arrested on some
false charge and it would work."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143'>[143]</a></span>

<p>
Another good hotel is the Roma, two stories high and
built on the patio system.
</p>

<p>
The Central Argentina Railroad and the Central of
Córdoba both print luxurious illustrated folders and do
much advertising relative to the beauties and charming
mountain scenery of the Sierra de Córdoba, an uninteresting
range of quasi barren hills in the neighborhood of the
city. My advice to strangers is to pay no attention to
these deceptive advertisements and not to go there, for
the person that "bites" feels afterwards like "the fool
with his money parted." This last might apply to
pecuniary losses that are apt to befall him at the green
cloth tables in Alta Gracia. This Sierra de Córdoba is
an irregular mass of rocky hills, which in some places
attains the form of mountains. The summits are over
four thousand feet high and where this altitude is reached
in the mountains to the west, the Córdobese call them Los
Gigantes (The Giants) for they have never seen any
mountains that are greater. They are covered with
brush, while here and there is a small tree. As for scenic
beauty they are not worth three cents.
</p>

<p>
Alta Gracia is a great gambling establishment licensed
by the provincial authorities, and as these railroad companies
know the bend of the native mind, advertise this
place which besides the gambling house is nothing but a
large hotel, a hamlet, and an old mission church. I visited
all the advertised places which include Dique San Roque,
Cosquin, La Falda, Tanti, and Capilla de Monte and found
none worth the while. Dique San Roque is a dam somewhat
similar to the Sweetwater Dam near San Diego,
California, where a greenish lake empties its waters into
the Calera River to supply electrical power. It is twenty
miles from Córdoba, the last five being the only part of the
trip that can come anywhere near to being classified under
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144'>[144]</a></span>
the title scenery. The hills here are wooded with small
trees, and the dangerous automobile road runs around
promontories on ledges where the slightest mishap with
the steering would shoot both passenger and chauffeur
into eternity.</p>

<p>
To go to Cosquin, thirty-seven miles from Córdoba,
keep straight ahead until you reach the stone marked
kilometro 28, which is the turning-off place for Dique San
Roque. Keep straight ahead and you will come to the
hamlet of San Roque where is a church and the residence
of the jefe politico. A road to the left leads to Alta
Gracia, but that to the right goes to Cosquin. After a
long drive over the rocky karst, the village of Villa Bialet
Masset is reached. It consists of a long dusty street
flanked by sordid one-story houses. A National Consumptives
Home on a grandiose scale is here. The scenery
has become better as there is a green, although dusty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145'>[145]</a></span>
valley watered by the Cosquin River. Cosquin is an
unattractive town of three thousand inhabitants. The
Hotel Mundial serves good meals but there is no diversion
for its guests, who pass the time of day reading novels on
the veranda or slumber in the garden.

<p>
The inhabitants of the Province of Córdoba talk in a
sing song manner and are known by their fashion of articulation
in any part of the republic they may chance to
find themselves in.

It is a ten hours' ride on the accommodation train from
Córdoba to Rosario, although the express trains which
run by night only shorten the time by a couple of hours.
The country is a dry but productive plain, and is fairly
thickly settled; every few miles there is a town. These
range from a few hundred to a few thousand inhabitants.
In the summer of 1916 the whole region had been planted
to corn, but the locust pest had been so busy that there
was nothing left but the bare stalks. This disaster
reached to the outskirts of Rosario. The locusts had even
eaten all the leaves off the trees, their naked branches
having the appearance of their winter garb. Millions
of dollars had gone to waste on account of them, and
I know an <i>estanciero</i> in the Province of Buenos Aires who
in a single year had destroyed by them sixty-five thousand
dollars' worth of crops. They attack everything but the
garden truck, and by their sputum poison the streams.
A man should never buy land for crops in Argentina without
reckoning on this plague.

<p>
The Province of Santa Fé had, according to the last
census, a population of 1,111,426, ranking in this line
the second of the Argentine provinces. Its area is 50,916
square miles and has as its capital city, Santa Fé, which
has a population of 91,636. Rosario, frequently called
Rosario de Santa Fé to distinguish it from Rosario de
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146'>[146]</a></span>
La Frontera in the Province of Salta, is the largest city.
Its population is 316,914, it being the second city of Argentina,
and the sixth in South America, those larger
in order being Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo,
Santiago, and Montevideo.
</p>

<p>
Rosario was founded by Francisco Godoy in 1725, but
its growth dates from recent years. Although its aspect
was practically the same as when I saw it three years
previously, I could not help noticing that now there were
much greater crowds on the streets than formerly, and
that the principal business street had changed from the
Calle General San Martin to its intersector, Calle Córdoba.
It is the outlet to a grain country superior to that
behind Buenos Aires, and is the livest commercial city
in Argentina. There are quite a few local industries such
as car shops, a sugar refinery, grain elevators, flour mills,
and breweries. The largest importing house in Argentina,
that of Chiesa Brothers, is located here as well as the
largest drug firm. The city is essentially Italian, its
influence predominating, although numerically the other
foreigners and natives together have a larger population
than the immigrants from the Lavinian shores. Rosario
is also a center for artisans, their sculptors vying with
those of Genoa in the chiseling of marble for tombs and
statuary in Buenos Aires and in different parts of South
America. The city is by no means beautiful nor can it ever
be on account of the flatness of its location. There are
eight small plazas but none of them are near the center
of business. The streets are narrow, and are solidly lined
with buildings many of which are imposing. This with
the absence of plazas as breathing spaces, together with
the street crowds give to Rosario an entirely commercial
atmosphere. The courthouse is a large, long pile with a
high domed tower surmounting the center, and is one of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147'>[147]</a></span>
the most imposing buildings in Argentina. It is on the
north side of the Plaza San Martin about a mile from the
hub of activity of the city. On the east side of the same
plaza, and just completed, is the Police Headquarters
covering an entire block and undoubtedly the most modern
and largest of its kind in the world. Two other fine
buildings are the Jockey Club and the Centro Español,
both also recently completed.</p>

The Hotel Italia is the best, although its situation on a
side street, the Calle Maipu, between Calles Rioja and
San Luis is poor. The Savoy where I stopped, was
formerly Rosario's Blackstone, but it has greatly deteriorated
in all respects. The only thing attractive about it
is the chambermaid on the second floor, a pretty giggling
Spanish damsel. The Hotel de Mayo is a good second-class
house and serves the best meals of any of the hotels,
its restaurant rivaling that of the Rôtisserie Sportsman
which is above the Bar Victoria. This Bar Victoria is the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149'>[149]</a></span>
finest refreshment parlor in South America. Its walls are
decorated with tapestry, its furniture is of mahogany, and
its fixtures are of brass, kept well-polished. It gave one
of the Catalan waiters great pleasure to see me cross its
threshold after an absence of three years and enjoy a glass
of foaming Germania in the dull cathedral light of a waning
day.</p>

Tributary to Rosario, which is their shopping center,
and inland some distance in the heart of good farming

lands, are three towns: Pergamino, seventy miles to the
south, Casilda, thirty-three miles to the southwest, and
Cañada de Gomez, forty-one miles to the west. Pergamino,
the largest of all, is in the Province of Buenos Aires,
being directly across the provincial line and is a railroad
town. It is the junction of several branch lines of the
Central of Argentina Railroad and is on the main line of
the narrow gauge General Railroads of the Province of
Buenos Aires. It has a population of twenty-eight
thousand inhabitants and owes its prosperity to stock
raising and corn growing.</p>

This city I visited, choosing it as a good example of
<i>campo</i> town for such is styled the Argentine prairie, and
stopped over night at the excellent Hotel Roma, which
is not only remarkable as being one of the finest buildings
in the city, but strange to say is one of the few hotels in
Argentina, excluding Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Tucumán,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152'>[152]</a></span>
which has private baths in connection with the sleeping-rooms.</p>

<p class='caption'>Plaza 25 de Mayo, Pergamino</p>
</div>

<p>
Viewed from the housetops, Pergamino appears a city
of windmills; they rise everywhere. Water being scarce
makes them a necessity. The city which is compactly
built is fundamentally Italian. It is compactly built but
has only one main street, that named San Nicolás, which
is paved with wooden creosote blocks. The buildings
are mostly but a single story high, and the nomenclatures
over the store entrances savor of the River Po or the
Etruscan Hills. With the exception of Calle San Nicolás,
the other thoroughfares are unpaved. The edifices that
flank them are of reddish brown brick with a minimum of
mortar or lime between the cracks. Like the outskirts
and side streets of most of the small towns of Argentina,
the aspect is hideous and dismal, for the edifices are mere
brick hovels bordering dusty lanes, abounding with mongrel
curs that munch offal and garbage thrown from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153'>[153]</a></span>
front windows of the morgue-like habitations. There is
in Pergamino a plaza, named 25 de Mayo, several blocks
from the business section. It is large and poorly kept up,
and is bordered on all sides by double rows of pine trees,
which have attained a tall but slender growth, large
enough however to make saw timber. These trees were
planted thirty years ago; at home it would take them one
hundred years to have attained the same proportions.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Mercedes</p>
</div>

<p>
From Pergamino to Buenos Aires, 166 miles by the
General Railroad of the Province of Buenos Aires, only
two towns are passed that have any pretext for importance.
They are Salto, thirty-six miles from Pergamino,
and Mercedes, sixty-nine miles from Buenos Aires.
Mercedes has a population of more than thirty thousand
inhabitants, and strange to say its streets are numbered
instead of being named. This system is different from
ours for 1st Street crosses 25th Street, and 34th Street
crosses 16th Street, and so forth. It is so arranged that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154'>[154]</a></span>
the high-numbered streets are in the center of the town
while the low-numbered ones are on the outskirts. When
the trains make their first stop it is at the 25th Street
station. The stranger traveling through is apt to say:
"Gee, but this is quite a town," judging by the high
numbers of its streets, while in reality 1st Street is way
out in the meadows far from the activity of central life.
Mercedes was formerly the stamping ground of Irish
immigrants. Many of these have become rich and powerful,
and to-day retain their Hibernian names without
speaking a word of English. I met a girl in Buenos
Aires whose patronymic was O'Grady, yet she was conversant
in no language but Spanish. Some of the
Irish settlers did not prosper as well as the minority of
the rich landed proprietors of Mercedes; this is testified
by the native born whiskered Irish bums who immigrated
from Mercedes to Buenos Aires who are seen wandering
about the streets of the Argentine capital, garbed in rags
and invariably drunk on ginevra, a low-grade gin.

<h2>
CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="s08">ASUNCIÓN</span>
</h2>

<p>
Overeating, oversleeping, and overindulgence in liquid
refreshments (this applies to soft drinks as well as to
others) constitute the whole time of the stranger in Buenos
Aires, who has nothing else to do, than, seated at a table in
front of one of the cafés on the Avenida de Mayo, to study
human nature, and watch the endless stream of humanity,
horses, cabs, and automobiles pass by. Tiring of this I
thought of going to Mar del Plata and from some good
point of vantage gaze in admiration at the attractions of
that spa, and look with pleasure at the latest Parisian and
Bonaerense creations that bedecked and showed off to
advantage the well-molded female forms of the high
aristocracy as they pass in parade in front of the Hotel
Bristol and the Casino.
</p>

<p>
Quite suddenly, and very unusual for this time of the
year, for it was late in February, a great climatic change
took place and the temperature which had been hovering
around the 100° mark dropped into the fifties. One
gloomy morning, as I stood gazing from the balcony of
my room into the Avenida de Mayo, watching the boulevardiers
being hurried along by the strong wind, I decided
that Mar del Plata would be no place for me. My
thoughts diverted to warmer climes, Paraguay and Brazil.
There is a Paraguayan store on the Avenida, a favorite
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156'>[156]</a></span>
shopping place for ladies and curio seekers. It has displays
of egrets, feathers, stuffed birds, stuffed toads,
crocodiles, iguanos, armadillo shells, yerba maté leaves,
native headdresses of parrot wings, and beetles. But
by far the most attractive of anything in the store is the
fine Paraguayan girl, about twenty years old, who waits
on the customers. I cannot call her beautiful, yet there
is something so hypnotically fascinating about her that,
after I first saw her, I was always returning to the store
again to feast my eyes on her with the pretense of making
some trivial purchase. Whether it was her eyes, her face,
her voice, her figure or her natural complexion, or all these
attractions combined that charmed me, I am unable to
say, and my friends whom I called in to look at her all said
that she exerted over them the same spell. Every time
I saw this girl I had the longing to revisit Paraguay, and
this, combined with the horrid weather, decided me at once
to visit the land where San Martin, Francia, and Francisco
Solano Lopez first saw the light of day.
</p>

<p>
I had been in Paraguay before, once when Asuncion was
under martial law, and although I now knew that I would
see nothing new in visiting the country, there are always
some places that the traveler enjoys seeing more than
once. Upon my leaving there before, great was my rejoicing
when I saw the blue, white, and blue flag of Argentina
floating from the flagstaff over the custom-house at
Corrientes, for I knew that I was once more in a country of
law and order. At that time Paraguay was at the height
of one of the many revolutions that have continuously
stained her history for the last forty-five years, and Asuncion
was like a tomb. Now since everything was tranquil
I would enjoy myself more.
</p>

<p>
It is now possible to travel from Buenos Aires to
Asuncion without changing cars on a through vestibuled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157'>[157]</a></span>
train with sleeping cars and a dining car. The time en
route is but fifty-three hours, for the train leaves Buenos
Aires thrice weekly at 3 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span>, and arrives at Asuncion two
days afterwards at 8 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> Formerly Posadas was the
terminus of the trains from Buenos Aires, and the travelers
were obliged to wait in that stamping ground of Heidecker,
Rohrsetzer, and Barthe anywhere from two to
five days in order to make connection with the Paraguay
Central Railroad, which ran at irregular intervals of time
to Asuncion from Villa Encarnacion, the Paraguayan
river port about two miles across the Alto Paraná River
from Posadas. The through train is now taken on a ferry-boat
a short distance above Posadas and is steamed
across to the Paraguayan railway terminus at Pacu Cua.
</p>

<p>
Three hours after leaving the Chacarita Station at
Buenos Aires, the lonesome town of Zarate is reached,
where the train is transferred onto a car ferry that plies to
Ibicui, a trip of nearly five hours through the estuaries
that form the delta of the Paraná River, past marshes
abounding in wild fowl who have their nests on the
swampy islands. Although this delta is but three hours
from Buenos Aires, it might as well be in the center of the
continent as far as civilization is concerned. The crossing
of this delta is always made obnoxious on account of the
mosquitoes which abound here. In making this crossing
most of the passengers were in the dining car. Here
one could observe types. Most were Paraguayans of the
upper classes returning home after a week's visit in the
Argentine metropolis. Although all had just left Buenos
Aires that name was but infrequently mentioned. In
every sentence of their conversation was heard the word
"Asuncion," a name which to the true Paraguayan means
much more to them than does New York to us, or Paris
to the Frenchman. It is the focus of all Paraguayan life,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158'>[158]</a></span>
and although it would be but a mediocre city in this
country, it is the only one of size in Paraguay.
</p>

<p>
There are two distinct types of Paraguayans. The first
type of men are good sized, fairly stout, with round faces.
Their eyebrows and moustaches are straight and have the
appearance of being penciled. The noses of these people
are Roman and their facial characteristics are strong and
sensual. This type is only met with among the very
highest social classes such as were the occupants of the
dining car the night we crossed the delta. One of these
men has one of the largest importing and general merchandise
stores in Asuncion. His surname is Angulo. The
other type of Paraguayan, which comprises the masses,
and with whom one does not come into contact in a casual
way, are swarthy, flat-chested, and narrow-shouldered.
They have large ears and low foreheads, bushy eyebrows
and thin noses. The middle class is not native. It is
composed of Spanish, German, Italian, and French merchants.
Mr. James Bryce in his book, <i>South America:
Observations and Impressions</i>, said in speaking of La Paz
Bolivia: "It has probably a larger aboriginal population
than any other city in the New World, although the
percentage of Indians may be somewhat greater in Asuncion,
the capital of Paraguay." There are no Indians,
and there is but little mixed blood in Asuncion. The
early settlers originally married with the natives but the
taint of miscegenation has long run out. The Asuncenos
are a white folk in every respect. Indians predominate in
the Bolivian capital and Bryce has never been in Asuncion.

During our evening meal on the dining car, a large
beetle or bug, in circumference the size of a tea cup, flew
in through the open window and made a terrific buzzing,
the noise being equal to that of those toys for children
which one winds up and then lets go. It flew all over the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159'>[159]</a></span>
room and as its bite would undoubtedly be poisonous, it
put all the occupants of the car in a pandemonium as each
one was trying to get out of the way of it. It seemed to be
in several different places at the same time.
</p>

<p>
It was near midnight when we reached the Entre Rios
shore. The Entrerrieno landscape as far as Concordia is
gently undulating, and the soil which is sandy is given
over to the pasturing of herds of horses. There is not
much grain grown and it is just as well, for occasionally
a dark cloud was seen approaching on the horizon, which,
when it broke, it was seen to be billions on billions of
locusts on their way to Uruguay. They flew into the train
windows, into the food, into the dining car, up one's
trouser legs and coat sleeves. The noise of their crunching
was most disgusting as one trod upon them while they
littered the aisles of the cars. When seized, they expectorate
a dark brown fluid of a most nauseating odor. They
fly into the streams and wells, poisoning the water.
Before arriving at Concordia, we crossed a palmetto
wilderness called, in this part of the country, a <i>palmar</i>.
Concordia, although not the capital, is the largest city of
Entre Rios. It has passed in population Paraná and now
has 48,500 inhabitants according to the latest estimate.
It is the largest and liveliest town in Argentina east of the
Paraná River and is connected by a bridge over the Uruguay
River to Salto in Uruguay, which was only contemplated
at the time of my visit to these cities three years
before. A street-car line has been recently built and with
its beef-canning establishments and as the center of a wine
producing region, Concordia has some future, although
the soil is sandy. This soil is much better adapted for fruit
than for grain. Oranges, apples, and olives are grown.
</p>

<p>
From Concordia the train ceases to run over the rails
of the Entre Rios Railroad but runs on the track of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160'>[160]</a></span>
Northeastern Argentine Railroad as far as Posadas.
After leaving Chajari, the Province of Corrientes is
entered and the landscape immediately changes. The
country is still undulating, but the soil is rich and even
soggy in places from frequent rains which are prevalent
here. Everything is green and as far as the eye can see,
horses and cattle graze on the short grass. Water is
everywhere. There are puddles in the fields; there are
small lakes; numerous streams are crossed. The blue
water of the Uruguay River is at one's right beyond
which, so near that you feel as if you could reach out your
hand and grab them, are the rolling green hills of Brazil.
Monte Caseros is reached at 4:20 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span>, a town of about
eight thousand inhabitants which contains the head offices
of the Northeastern Argentine Railroad. Paso de los
Libres is reached at 7:18 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span>, whence one can cross by
ferry to Uruguayana, a Brazilian city in the State of Rio
Grande do Sul on which Francisco Solano Lopez, Paraguayan
dictator, tried to march his army in 1866. This
town has its name handed down to posterity by the <i>cepo
uruguayana</i>, a barbaric method of torture which originated
there and which was frequently employed by Artigas,
Rosas, Lopez, and by other tyrants of a similar caliber.
At bedtime the train stops at Alvear, an important livestock
town.
</p>

<p>
The peasants are now Indians. They live in adobe and
cane huts in the fields and are a peaceable, pastoral people.
The men, both whites and Indians, wear great baggy
trousers, not unlike a couple of potato sacks; these are tied
to the leg above the shoe by a leather strap or cord. From
the discoloration of some of these trousers, I would not be
surprised to hear that they came over with the Spanish
Conquistadores.
</p>

<p>
At daybreak of the second day, a train was ferried
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161'>[161]</a></span>
across the Alto Paraná River to Pacu Cua. The only
change that I noticed relative to the train, and this was
only a detail, was that the beer now served was not the vile
concoction brewed in Buenos Aires but a clear amber
liquid, purer in substance and fresh from the brewery of
Villa Encarnacion.
</p>

<p>
The Paraguayan landscape, until the half-way station
of Borja is reached, is a great semi-swampy plain with low
hills and ridges covered with tropical undergrowth, here
known as "islands." By speaking of this plain as swampy,
I do not mean that it is under water, for such is not the
case; some seasons of the year it is quite dry and after
heavy rains only it is soggy. It is always passable, but is
overgrown with swamp grass. Countless herds of cattle
pasture here; otherwise it is uninhabitable. It contains
many lakes and lagoons alive with wild ducks, plover, curlew,
herons, and other water fowl; wild geese fly overhead,
and when a clump of bushes is passed it is a common
sight to see the dark plumed, heavy limbed <i>ñandú</i>, the
native ostrich, shading itself under a bough on these
wooded islets. Rising from the plain are many huts,
the estancias of the natives, half hidden by the foliage.
They are built of cane, plastered over, and with thatched
roofs.
</p>

<p>
At Borja the junction for the village of Charara,
the scenery changes. The land now high and dry is
intersected by numerous rivers. Mountains appear to
the north, and from here to Asuncion the country has a
well-settled character with numerous well-built villages.
Civilization in Paraguay started from Asuncion and
followed the high ridge of land eastward. The railroad
built from Asuncion to Paraguari is one of the oldest in
South America. From Paraguari onward to Borja,
civilization preceded the railroad.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162'>[162]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Villa Rica has 34,297 inhabitants according to a Paraguayan
estimate. Personally I think that this should
be cut in two. It is a mile northeast of the depot. At a
station named Tebicuary is a sugar mill; at Caballero are
the railroad shops.</p>

<p class='caption'>Scene from Railroad Station at Villa Rica</p>
</div>

<p>
Paraguari, the anti-bellum terminus of the Central
Paraguay Railroad, has, according to the census 11,328
inhabitants, although I am doubtful if its population
exceeds five thousand. It is situated in the extreme
eastern end of the Pirayu valley. This valley is bound
by great basaltic hills, some of which are mountains.
Some are conical in shape, but the majority are huge
hills, whose tops are great stone outcrops. The floor of
the valley is high and a cool breeze is generally blowing.
The clover and grain, together with the mountains and the
church steeples, remind one of the scenery in Central
Europe. Paraguari would be the best situated city in
Paraguay for its capital, both from a natural location and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163'>[163]</a></span>
from a military point of view. It was the camping ground
of the Argentine army under General Belgrano in 1811.
Formerly the Jesuits had a large stock ranch here.
</p>

<p>
The railroad, formerly owned by the government, but
now controlled by a Portuguese, had originally a six-foot
gauge. The depots in the villages from Paraguari to
Asuncion are large and old-fashioned like the pictures of
those stations depicted in <i>Harper's Weekly</i> Civil War Scenes.
Their mere duplicates to-day are to be seen in some European
cities such as those at Caen, Bar-le-Duc, Vicenza,
the old station at Strassburg, and in the American cities
of Savannah and Macon. The English company which
had control of the railroad before this Portuguese got it
narrowed the gauge down to the regulation broad gauge
standard which is narrower than that of the Central
Argentina and several other lines in that republic.
</p>

<p>
The Republic of Paraguay is divided into twenty districts
exclusive of Asuncion. I am giving their names and
population together with those of their capitals and their
population according to the estimate of 1917 in Héctor F.
Decoud's <i>Geografia de la Republica del Paraguay, Asuncion,
1917</i>. The population of these district capitals
includes the commune as well as the town, for with the
exception of six cities, Asuncion, Villa Rica, Caazapá,
Villa Encarnacion, Villa Concepcion, and Villa del Pilar
there are no incorporated places in the republic:&mdash;

Total population, 828,130 inhabitants exclusive of about
50,000 wild Indians living in the Gran Chaco.
</p>

<p>
The population of Asuncion has been estimated from
80,000 to 125,000 inhabitants. Personally I think that
100,000 would be more nearly correct. Asuncion of 1918
is an entirely different city from Asuncion in 1913, so great
has been the visible improvement. This is largely due to
the enlightened ideas of the ex-dictator, Don Eduardo
Schaerer, a Swiss by birth, and who has infused European
progressiveness into the Paraguayan nation, whose population
was rapidly being exterminated by forty-five years
of incessant revolutions on top of a five years' war which
cost Paraguay five hundred thousand lives. Schaerer
has showed that he is the man for the job. His rule has
been benign but firm. No sooner had he assumed the
executive power than some of his dissatisfied opponents
tried the tricks on him that have been tried on other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165'>[165]</a></span>
dictators. This time they failed. The bomb that they
touched off underneath his residence failed to explode.
The conspirators and other suspects were immediately
clapped into jail. January 1, 1915, witnessed the close of
two years' peace; it was too much of a good thing for the
fire-eating populace so they started another revolution.
This lasted but one day, the revolutionists losing over
three hundred men in a street fight in Asuncion. No more
tricks have been tried on Señor Schaerer.
</p>

<p>
In Asuncion there live numerous ex-presidents, ex-dictators,
and their political henchmen. No matter who
is president of any country, there are always a number of
people who have grievances against the administration,
but I have only heard one person express anything derogatory
against Schaerer. This man, very prominent in
Asuncion, and the son of an ex-president, said that Schaerer
owed his power as Chief Executive to the Farquhar
Syndicate whose money placed him there in order for them
to obtain in return valuable concessions. He said that
Schaerer was not president for his health, but was amassing
a fortune on the side. If this is true, it is nothing
extraordinary, but as far as I can glean, he is one of the
most able presidents the country has ever had. Results
show it. Paraguay has a good constitution, but it is
never used. Changes have been constantly made to suit
the whims of each dictator. The presidential term is
for three years. Schaerer's term should have expired
November 25, 1915, but he saw to it that there would be
no elections and two years after that date he retained his
office.
</p>

<p>
Since Señor Schaerer became president, there have been
many changes for the better in Asuncion. Formerly one
had to go to the post office to mail a letter; now letter-boxes
are on nearly every corner. The stranger is no longer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166'>[166]</a></span>
subjected to surveillance, neither are his valises searched
in the hotels, nor are his letters opened and read in the
post office before transmission. The police have new
crash uniforms as well as many of the soldiers; previously
their garments were nondescript. It is necessary in Paraguay
to maintain a semblance of an army, for otherwise
a dictator's life would hang on the thread of Damocles.
In order to pay this army, the present government was
obliged to sell their two gunboats, as the country is in a
bad financial condition. Its unit, the <i>peso fuerte</i> is worth
only 2½ cents American currency. Five years ago it was
worth 7 cents. This depreciation of money is current all
over the southern republics of South America with the
exception of Uruguay and Argentina. The Chilean peso
was worth 23 cents in 1913; now it is worth 17 cents; the
Brazilian milreis which was then worth 33⅓ cents is worth
now only 25 cents. In Brazil, and in Chile although the
currency depreciated, the price of articles dropped in
ratio, so that now in those countries the articles for sale
can be bought cheaper than formerly. Not so in Paraguay.
When the peso fuerte took a drop, the staple goods
remained the same in price, so now a person has to pay
three pesos for what formerly cost him but one.
</p>

<p>
The electric lighting system of Asuncion is excellent,
and it now has the best trolley car service of any South
American city. Every principal street has car tracks and
the tramcars run in the daytime every five minutes.
There is also a suburban system. Before Schaerer's
ascendancy, the city had mule cars, and a suburban steam
road that ran through the streets of the city, as in Debreczen,
Hungary, the engine of which puffed and emitted
much smoke to the tune of squeaks and much whistling.
The lawn is kept up in front of the Capitol; new streets
have been opened and paved; statues have been unveiled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167'>[167]</a></span>
in public places, and there has been considerable building
done.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i192" id="i192"></a>
<img src="images/i-192.jpg" width="542" height="323" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Casa de Gobierno, or Capitol, Asuncion</p>
</div>

<p>
At first sight, Asuncion seems small. This is due to
the grass that grows between the stones of the street
pavement, and to the fact that cows graze in the plazas.
On account of the richness of the soil and the frequent
rains it is impossible to keep vegetation down. Unfortunately
the plazas are not well kept up, and have gone to
waste and ruin. The city is compactly built, and covers
considerable ground. Like Belgrade, Servia, it is built on
the side of a hill; like Belgrade the stores are similar in
window decorations, for their proprietors specialize in
displaying there articles that are favorite to the Paraguayan
mind as well as to the Servian: firearms and
knives. There are a few large buildings of modern construction,
but what is most observant are the colonnades
of pillars and piers which support the roofs. If a building
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168'>[168]</a></span>
has no colonnade along the street, it is sure to have one
around the patio. These colonnades are built thus (see
drawing).

</div>

<p>
Pillars (fig. b) lower than the main wall (fig. a) are
erected about twelve feet or less in front of it. Across
the tops of these pillars and connecting them lies a beam
(fig. c) from which rafters (fig. d) at regular intervals slant
up to the top of the wall of the building. Horizontally
across these rafters are laid stringers (fig. e) about a foot
apart. On top of these stringers are laid tiles (fig. f).
In many cases a thin layer of bricks is laid across the
stringers, above which are laid the tiles.
</p>

<p>
The worst feature of Asuncion is the paving of the streets.
Black flint stones of all sizes and shape are pounded tightly
into the ground, and their crevices are filled with the red
earth of the country; they are then treated with a coating
of dirt. For the first three months this pavement makes
excellent driving. Then when the copious rains have
washed the dirt out, the stones settle or are loosened. An
occasional wagon-wheel knocks one out of place, and it is
seldom replaced. Incessant wear now makes ruts among
the loosened stones, and in the part of the road where
there is not much traffic, vegetation grows up, likewise
forcing the stones up. The city is built on the side of a
hill sloping down to a lagoon which is separated from the
Paraguay River by a swamp. There are no conduits to
carry away the rain water, nor any ditches at the sides of the
streets. Accordingly when it rains, the water runs down
the hill through the crevices between the paving stones, and
by the time it reaches the main street, Calle Palmas, the
side streets are turned into rivers. Eave troughs project
horizontally from the roofs over the streets, and the pedestrians
have a choice between two evils, walking in the
flowing road or getting a dousing from many hydrants.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169'>[169]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
With the exception of an English church in the suburbs
and a German Lutheran one in the city, both of which are
so small that it seems a shame to rank them under the title
of church, there are only three Houses of God in Asuncion,
the cathedral, San Roque, and that of the Church of the
Encarnacion. The cathedral is an old, weather-beaten
affair facing the lagoon. San Roque is very old and faces
a small plaza of the same name behind the railway station.
The most imposing building in the city is the mammoth
unfinished red brick pile which goes by the name of the
Church of the Encarnacion. If ever completed it will
hold a place among the world's great religious edifices.
It is built on the summit of the hill above the business
section of the city and is a landmark for many miles. It
is reached by a double flight of steps from the street.
It was started during the reign of Francia, and the money
having long since given out, it is left but half completed.
It is built very solidly of tightly fitting red brick, and was
intended to be stuccoed over. A place is left for a tower
each side of the main door but they have never been commenced.
The interior is plain, has been given a fresh coat
of plaster, and exudes the funereal tuberose smell which is
present in the casino at Monte Carlo to counteract the
aroma of corpses in the private morgue beneath the
roulette room of that establishment. As matters now
stand the Church of the Encarnacion is a hideous pile.
The earthly remains of Dr. Gaspar Rodrigues de Francia,
Paraguay's most famous dictator, 1816-1840, were buried
beneath the vestibule of this church. The relatives of
a person whom he had executed had his bones dug up and
desecrated them by flinging them into the lagoon.</p>

<p>
The plazas of Asuncion are a disgrace to the city. The
Plaza Uruguaya is the largest. It is planted with trees
which are scattered at random. A brick wall separates
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170'>[170]</a></span>
one side of it from the street. At the opposite side is the
large, graceful, colonnaded, battle-scarred railway station
with its illuminated clock tower. Pedestrians avoid
traversing this plaza after nightfall on account of footpads,
many of whom would commit murder for a paper peso.
In the center of the plaza stand the fragments of a marble
statue shot to pieces in the revolution of 1904. The
Plaza de la Republica is on top of the high banks that
skirt the swampy ground that forms the shores of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171'>[171]</a></span>
lagoon. In some places it is like a big field, especially
that part of it in front of the artillery barracks where it
is the dumping ground of tin cans and refuse, and is traversed
by cattle paths. Near the House of Congress, a
morbid appearing porticoed edifice, it assumes the nature
of a lawn which in turn becomes a park in front of the
ancient cathedral. In this plaza is a cheap looking brick
column named the Statue of Liberty. This monument is
surmounted by the image of San Blas, the patron saint of
Paraguay, in whose honor is celebrated on February 3d
of each year an orgy that beggars description. The base
of the statue has the dates of different events and revolutions
painted in black letters on each of its four faces.
One of these dates tells the reader that Asuncion was
founded August 15, 1536. Another date tells of the
ousting of the Spanish domination. A third one informs
us of the end of Francia's rule, while the fourth bears
testimony of the end of the reign of Lopez II.</p>

<p>
One of the features that attracts the eyes of strangers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172'>[172]</a></span>
is that there is scarcely a building in the downtown district
that is not pitted with holes from a Gatling gun. In some
sections whole walls have been shot away by cannon balls.
One of the beautiful trees common to Paraguay is the
dark fern-leaved <i>paraiso</i> tree. There are a great many of
these in Asuncion, especially in the Plaza San Roque.
Their foliage is thick and gives delightful shade.</p>

One of the landmarks is the brick domed basilica on the
Calle Palmas called the Oratory of Lopez. The tyrant
had it built for the receptacle of the image of the Virgin
of the Assumption (Asuncion). The Five Years' War
came on, and the oratory was never completed. It stands
to-day without a coat of stucco, with the carpenters' scantling
around its dome in the same condition now as when
work suddenly ceased in 1865. It is owned by the government
which is too poor to complete it; its floor is used
for the storage of municipal timber, brick, plaster, and
so forth, in charge of an ancient pensioner. Bats roost
beneath its dome, and the <i>amberé</i> lizards crawl between
the cracks of the bricks. The oratory is surrounded by a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173'>[173]</a></span>
wall over which projects a papaya tree whose luscious
golden fruit, shaped like a woman's teat, hangs in pendulent
clusters from its crown. This fruit is known in Paraguay
as <i>mamon</i> which in the Guarani language means tit.</p>

<p>
The Asuncenos are early risers. The stores open at
6 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span>, and an hour later is when the greatest crowds are
to be found on the streets. The stores close again at 11
<span class='s08'>A.M.</span>, and remain so till 2 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> They close for the day at
7 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span>, and remain shut all day Sunday as well as on the
numerous holidays. During the three midday hours
there is hardly a person to be seen on the streets. Asuncion
is never activity, excepting during periods of revolution
and at the annual yearly carnival; on Sundays the
liveliness of the streets can be compared with that of
the interior of a cemetery receiving vault. It is a trifle
better than Valparaiso, Chile, or Detroit, Michigan, on
those days because at least the cafés are open. The
amusements of the city are paltry, the main one being to
sit evenings in one's shirt-sleeves on a chair placed on the
sidewalk in front of one's residence and by the illumination
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174'>[174]</a></span>
of the electric lights watch the great <i>cucurús</i> (large, disgusting
looking native toads) hop along the sidewalk in
search of bugs. The other amusements are two moving
picture shows, one at Belvedere and the other at the
Café Bolsa.</p>

<p>
The climate of Asuncion is hot, terribly so, and damp.
In heat it compares very favorably with Panama. It is
enervating and gives the people amorous inclinations,
especially when it blows from the north and east. Many
foreigners cannot become acclimated on account of their
inability in adapting themselves to a change in their mode
of life, and many of the wives of foreign diplomats have to
return home on account of the heat. Many people have
red spots on their faces and bodies caused by the heat.
The hottest month is December. The rainfall is heavy,
and in Asuncion it is regular. March is the wettest
month, with April and October following in order. July
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175'>[175]</a></span>
is the driest month. The average annual rainfall is 60.2
inches. (The average for Detroit is 37 inches.) The
driest year recorded in Asuncion was 1883 when 44.7
inches fell and the wettest year was 1878 with a precipitation
of 101.9 inches. The rains are of short duration,
but several are apt to occur in one day. They are tropical
and come straight down in sheets as if a bucket of water
had been turned upside down in the sky. These rains,
which are heaviest in summer, come up suddenly, and if
there are any clouds to be seen, it is advisable to carry an
umbrella for it often happens that these showers are local,
there being a great downpour in one part of the town and
no rainfall at all in the other. After and between rains,
the sun comes out and steam arises from the earth.
Many a hacking cough heard from behind the shutters of a
window and many a gob of phlegm seen on the street
sidewalk has its origin from this climatic change. Hurricanes
are unknown although water spouts are an occasional
phenomenon. The thunder makes terrific crashings,
and at each loud blast, the inhabitants make the sign of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176'>[176]</a></span>
cross. Even on days when it does not rain, the sky is
frequently overcast and the atmosphere has the muggy
feeling that is always present before a storm.
</p>

<p>
Perspiration runs from one in streams, not like the
heavy sweat of the hard-working laborer but a malodorous
vitality sapping sweat which takes the place of urine,
making it necessary to change one's under-clothing several
times daily and to indulge in frequent shower or sponge
baths. For the omnipresent prickly heat, one should
never besmear himself with ointment nor take cold baths;
these have the tendency to augment it. One should
bathe in warm or lukewarm water. Clothes sent to the
laundry come back damp and the bed linen seldom dries.
The houses are covered with a black mold which no
amount of frequent painting can stop coming back. During
the summer if you draw your finger across the wall of a
church interior it will leave a streak on the dampness.
Regardless of the heat, for sanitation's sake, hot air furnaces
should be installed in the hotels and residences and
a drying out should be given them once a week.
</p>

<p>
With the rains come myriads of bugs and beetles. A
black-winged one, half as big as a saucer, whose aviation
produced a noise like a rip-saw, assailed me one night
while at dinner in the Hotel Hispano-Americano. It flew
on my coat, and as I tried to brush it away it implanted a
sting on the back of my hand that made me wince in
agony. A lady, at a neighboring table, thought it was
funny, for she smiled at my discomfiture. God punished
her, for presently a huge green darning-needle shaped bug
lighted on her neck and the sting it gave her made her emit
squawks that rivaled in rancorousness those of a carrion
crow. Bugs, beetles, reptiles, etc., the Paraguayans
and Correntinos call <i>bich</i> and the large ones they call
<i>gran bich</i> without any distinction as to their specie. A
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177'>[177]</a></span>
person cannot fondle with impunity the cucurú as one can
the common American garden toad. The cucurú will bite
you and then close its jaws. It has to be killed to pry its
mouth apart and its bite is said to be poisonous. The
suburban sidewalks of Asuncion teem with them evenings.
The village of Areguá near Asuncion is especially prolific
in this variety of amphibian. It would not take many of
them to fill a bushel basket. I got about a dozen of these
by dropping my hat over them and chloroforming them.
I had them stuffed and brought them home as mantelpiece
presents for my friends. Paraguay is also abundant
in ophidians; the nasty, poisonous <i>mboy-chumbé</i> or black,
white, and red-ringed coral snakes being the most common.
There is <i>mboy-jhoby</i>, a green snake; the <i>ñuazo</i>, a dark
brown snake; the viper; the <i>ñandurié</i>, a small stick-like
snake and the rattlesnake are common venomous species,
while the huge boa, or <i>curiyu</i>, and the <i>mboy-yaguá</i>, or
water snake, belong to the unpoisonous kind. The great
viper called <i>ñacaniná</i> is semi-poisonous. Among the
quelonians is the <i>carumbé</i> a Brobdingnagian snapping
turtle and in the hydrosaurian class is the crocodile, cayman
alligator, and the iguana or <i>teyú</i>, the latter being esteemed
for its white meat not unlike spring chicken in taste.
</p>

<p>
There are two species of jaguar called tiger by the
natives, the <i>aguareté</i> and the <i>yaguareté-popé</i>. The word
jaguar is derived from the Guarani <i>yaguareté</i>. There are
several kinds of wild-cat, misnamed by the natives "lions,"
plenty of tapirs or <i>mborevi</i>, ant-eaters, wild pigs, armadillos,
deer, monkeys, besides many species of phlebotomists
such as the vampire-bat and the common belfry-bat.
The trees are alive with owls, macaws, parrots, toucans,
zorzals, and wild-pigeons, while in the swamps and clearings
are found egrets, martinets, sarias, cassowaries,
flamingoes, herons, and ibises.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178'>[178]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Asuncion has several fair hotels; the best in my estimation
being the Hotel Hispano-Americano, the property
of the firm of Rius &amp; Jorba which is rented to the
present proprietors, the Grau Brothers, two Spaniards, to
the tune of ten dollars a day, which, for Asuncion, is an
exorbitant sum. This hotel is not recommended to
strangers by the natives for the innate jealousy that the
average South American has for the Spaniard, who is his
business superior, is not lacking in Paraguay. The foreigners
recommend to the stranger the Hotel Saint-Pierre,
a French hotel, or the Cancha (formerly the Gran Hotel
del Paraguay), a stock company hotel under German
management.
</p>

<p>
The Hispano-Americano was built by the dictator,
Francisco Solano Lopez for his mistress, Madame Elisa
Lynch, and here he lived with her and here were his offsprings
by her brought up. As I lay in my bed, or walked
the arched galleries of this edifice, I could nearly see the
festivities, banquets, and parties that took place in the
great salon (now the dining room) fifty-three years ago,
hear the laughter of the beautiful women in hoop skirts
and the popping of corks of champagne bottles, and smell
the somniferous perfume of the <i>ñandeyara-guazús</i> (high
grade Paraguayan cigars) as their aroma was wafted
upwards with the smoke. Visions came to me of officers,
their uniforms resplendent with epaulettes and gold braid,
brave men who met valiant deaths on the field of battle or
through exposure in the soggy palmetto and mangrove
swamps of the interior, of foreign diplomats, of dark,
beautiful women wearing delicate, luxuriant <i>ñanduti</i> lace
shawls, of the short and corpulent bearded dictator with
the perpetual strong cigar between his lips, and of the
Irish asp, his mistress, whose power and influence upon
her naturally progressive and ambitious paramour was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179'>[179]</a></span>
greater than that of Theodora on Justinian. J. F. Masterman
in his <i>Seven Years' Adventures in Paraguay</i> states that
Madame Lynch could drink more champagne than any
person he ever knew and not seem to feel any effects
therefrom. I would like to have matched her in a contest
with a friend of mine, now dead, whom I saw drink six
quarts of champagne one after another standing at a bar in
San Francisco one evening in September, 1910.
</p>

<p>
The Hispano-Americano is a large structure two stories
high of imposing appearance on a corner of Calle Palmas,
the main street. It is well situated for it is near all the
banks, business houses, and government buildings. It
has a large patio paved with black and white tiles, where
the dining tables are placed. Bedrooms open off from
this patio. On each side of the entrance thirty-four
marble steps lead up to the second story which has a
balcony surrounding the patio, the arches of which are
supported by stone Doric columns. Onto this balcony
open tile-floored, high, and cool bedrooms. The balcony
is paved with brick and from it rise more Doric columns
surmounted by arches which support the roof. There
is a second patio, this one open, which is reached by a
short hall behind the first patio. On this are the cheaper
rooms. On my former visit this hotel was not well kept
up nor overclean, but now it was all that could be desired
and the Paraguayan cooking, with its abundance of oil,
peppers, tomatoes, and hot sauces, was excellent.
</p>

<p>
The proprietors own two Case automobiles, and one
evening as I sat in conversation with the Señor Grau, who
assumes the active management of the hotel, he suggested
that I should take a ride with him for a couple of hours.
This was fine and I hastened to accept. The machine was
brought in front of the door, Grau and myself had got into
it, when the assistant manager came out and said something
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180'>[180]</a></span>
in an undertone to Grau. The latter replied in a loud
voice:
</p>

<p>
"Give everybody a room that asks for one except the
Spanish consul. Give him nothing."
</p>

<p>
I thought this was queer but said nothing, thinking
that later on Grau would explain what was up. He did
not do so, however, until we returned which was about
ten o'clock at night. There were about a dozen people in
front of the hotel; on the threshold stood a tall, thin,
good-looking man about thirty-five years old, dressed in
black. When Grau got out this man approached him and
said:
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with this fellow?" pointing at
the assistant manager. "He refuses to give me a room."
</p>

<p>
"My instructions!" bellowed Grau. "You can get
nothing here!"
</p>

<p>
A small crowd began to collect. The Spanish consul,
for he was the tall man in black, asked Grau to explain.
</p>

<p>
"Explain nothing!" yelled Grau. "You can get no
more service here. You have come to this hotel three or
four different times, each time with a different woman,
and each time you have registered as man and wife. How
many wives have you anyway? I am not running a
house of prostitution. What do you take me for? Get
out!"
</p>

<p>
There was a general peal of laughter from the crowd
at this. The Spanish consul, unabashed, with a smile
walked away, stating that there were other hotels in the
town, where he could take his women, that were just as
good as Grau's and that he would do so now.
</p>

<p>
The Hotel Saint-Pierre is near the harbor on the Calle
Colon, a cheap business street. Many people prefer it for
their sojourn in Asuncion as it has the reputation for
having the best cooking. In this respect I found it lacking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181'>[181]</a></span>
in the abundance and in the variety of that of the
Hispano-Americano. There is no bar; the rooms are
small, and the proprietor frequently tells the guests to
retire to their rooms by a side entrance as he is engaged
entertaining friends in the hotel parlor and main entrance.
The proprietor is named Saint-Pierre, hence the name of
the hotel. He claims to be a French count, but the consensus
of most people is that he is crazy. He is a little,
bald-headed old man about sixty-five years old, with a gray
moustache and imperial. He orders the guests around as
if he was bestowing upon them a favor for allowing them
to get lodging there. Many people desiring to obtain
rooms there are expected to furnish a pedigree. Colonel
David Brainard, U. S. A., military attaché to the United
States Embassy at Buenos Aires, a very distinguished man
and one of the survivors of the famous Greely expedition
that attempted to discover the North Pole some time
ago, was on an extended trip through Paraguay with his
friends. From Villa Rica he telegraphed to Monsieur le
comte de Saint-Pierre engaging rooms. The latter worthy
before he would allow his distinguished guests-to-be to
take up their domicile at his establishment looked up their
character and antecedents much to the amusement and
disgust of Colonel Brainard and friends.
</p>

<p>
The Gran Hotel del Paraguay occupies several single
story buildings in a large lawn on a hill, a twenty minutes'
ride by cab from the business section of Asuncion. For a
man it is too far away to be handy, but it is an ideal place
for ladies with yarn to knit and novels to read. The
American consul rooms there. The bad feature of this
hotel is that the pedestrian at night in walking or driving
there should never take his finger from the trigger of his
Derringer, for thieves often lurk behind the giant locust
trees on the Avenida España. After 2 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span> the street
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182'>[182]</a></span>
lights go out; walking then up the umbrageous road is
nearly impossible.
</p>

<p>
Natives stop at the Hotels Kosmos, Español, Palermo,
and other similar dumps conducive to vermin, mosquitoes,
and malodorous toilets.
</p>

<p>
A Dutchman runs an excellent high-class pension named
Villa Colombia, where Argentine highbrows such as Don
Nicolas Mihanovich sojourn while visiting the city. This
is in a large lawn across the street from the Belvedere
gardens. While I was in Asuncion, there was a big hullabaloo
because some thief stole eleven thousand dollars
which the Dutchman had hidden in an envelope in his
residence.
</p>

<p>
The Capitol is a large barnlike rambling building with
broad verandas and is crowned with a square cupola. It
was built by Carlos Antonio Lopez and is the pride of the
inhabitants; its picture adorns the postage stamps of high
denominations and also the two peso paper currency.
</p>

<p>
Asuncion is the only South American city which has
stone sidewalks. They were originally built during the
regime of Lopez I., who was the patron of modernity.
Asuncion as well as Villa Encarnacion has brick sidewalks
like the Massachusetts towns. The bricks and tile are of
good quality and shape. The brick layers and stone
masons do better work here than in Argentina and the
rough brick buildings do not look as dilapidated as in the
last named republic. The red soil of Paraguay is adapted
to the manufacture of good bricks and a specie is turned
out akin to Bradford red.
</p>

<p>
There are three breweries in Paraguay: the one owned
by Bosio Brothers being the large fine one at the port.
There is a branch brewery at a suburb named Puerto
Sanjonia which is now closed down. This brewery and
that of the Cerveceria Montevideana at Montevideo,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183'>[183]</a></span>
Uruguay, brew the best beer in South America. The 14 de
Mayo brewery at Villa Encarnacion likewise turns out a
good product and there is a small German brewery at
San Bernardino in whose beer spring water is used. This
last mentioned brewery caters solely to family and local
trade like that of Ahrens in Córdoba and those of Peters
and of Degen in San Antonio, Texas. The Asuncion
drinking water of the hotels is the limit. They have no
wells but instead they have tanks on their roofs to catch
the rain water. These tanks are never cleaned and the
sides are covered with green fungus. A dead cat bloated
beyond recognition was found in the tank of the Hispano-Americano.
I drank the water without knowing it. At
home we eat frog's legs. The Asuncenos delight in eating
the body of the cucurús, the great garden toad. The
Chaco Indians rejoice in stewed monkey and fried slices
of <i>gran vibora</i>, a snake peculiar to that swamp, while the
iguana is held in edible estimation by the white population.
Locust pies and boiled parrot also find their way down
the alimentary canals of the aborigines.
</p>

<p>
The two places of the greatest interest to the stranger in
Asuncion are the cemetery of Mangrullo and the market-place.
The former is located beyond the city limits on
the road to Puerto Sajonia. It is on a high-road hill from
which an excellent panorama can be had of the city, the
river, and the Chaco beyond. The origin of the name is
unknown, but the word "Mangrullo" is always used to
denote the military lookout tower.
</p>

<p>
This cemetery is redolent with the thoughts of spooks,
banshee, ghosts, and other phantomic gentry of like
species. In daytime it is a lugubrious place nearly surrounded
by high walls, from above which tower slender
cypress trees, and at night it must be doubly so, especially
when the moon plays on the mortuary chapel from the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184'>[184]</a></span>
tree limbs. This cemetery is where the poor people are
buried; the wealthy are interred in the aristocratic
Recoleta.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i209" id="i209"></a>
<img src="images/i-209.jpg" width="541" height="338" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Mangrullo Cemetery, Asuncion</p>
</div>

<p>
On the path, long before reaching Mangrullo, wailing
is heard coming from within the enclosure. At the
entrance seated on the ground are aged women selling
fruit with <i>poguazú</i> cigars in their mouths. A leper or
two adds charm to the scene. They are not begging, but
expect everyone waiting for somebody to slip a peso bill
(2½ c.) into their spotted hands. From the iron entrance,
the only road in the cemetery leads to the chapel in the
center. Black clothed persons wander ghoulishly among
the tombstones, their hats in their hands. A concourse
of people is assembled in front of the building. Nearby is
a wooden tower, and on a platform underneath its roof a
hunchback is ringing the bell, making it peal at slow
intervals. The bell stops and the wailing of the bare-headed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185'>[185]</a></span>
assembly begins. This lasts about five minutes;
the hunchback then tolls the bell anew, this time in a rapid
succession of clangs. The men lift up the rude box
containing the dead person from which the olfactory aroma
of putrid flesh arises and carrying it to the shallow grave,
they bury it to the tune of the great bell which has again
started ringing. When the bell stops, the women start
wailing again and the men stand aside to smoke, talk
politics, and watch the scene. The wailing is not caused
so much through grief as it is to see who can make the
loudest noise.
</p>

<p>
A woman had lost her two weeks' old baby and her
relations as far removed as the fourth generation of
cousin had come to mourn. The shrieks emitted were
not human. They sounded more like the snarling and
growling of animals, the howling of hyenas and ululations
of owls. The women worked themselves into a frenzy of
hysteria, and the bereaved mother threw herself on the
grave and, lying on her back, kicked, struggled, and writhed
until she became unconscious through her own emotions.
One of these wailing fests that I witnessed came to a
sudden and untimely end. While the family and relatives
of a murdered man had reached a soprano in the shrieking
test, a ñacaniná (large viper) crawled from a hole beneath
a tombstone and, frightened at the lugubrious wails,
attempted to escape by safely crawling away. It took
its course among the mourners, and the hurried scamper
of footsteps to the tune of blasphemous and ungodly oaths
was now the order of the funeral aftermath.
</p>

<p>
The graves in the Mangrullo cemetery are so multitudinous
and so close together that it is impossible for a
funeral procession to reach the newly dug grave without
crossing numerous mounds. There are but few monuments,
iron crosses painted black taking their places.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186'>[186]</a></span>
Iron fences surround the graves of those who have well-to-do
relatives. But few inscriptions tell the age of the
beloved deceased; instead there hangs at each cross
a photograph likeness of the dead.
</p>

<p>
The market-place of Asuncion probably offers more
attractions to the stranger than in any other city. It is
situated in the middle of the town and has a large covered
frame building where meats are hung. Making a circumvallation
of the butcher shop are benches where sit women,
white, black, Indian, and mixed breed, offering for sale
cigars of their own manufacture. Outside on the ground
squat the rabble who cannot afford a chair at the benches.
They sell parrakeets, divers song-birds, the succulent
stubby native banana, curiously shaped peppers, avocados,
herbs, pineapples, and cooked viands. At the
entrance to the market are kiosks where caña or native
rum is dispensed. At 8:00 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span> the market-place represents
great animation. Lazy, fat lousy dogs, hundreds in
number, their bellies gorged with rare meat and offal, lie
in glutinous stupor in the aisles and under the shade of
large stationary umbrellas. They lick the grease from
the roasted meat for sale and urinate in the frying pans.
Ignorant natives purchase these meat roasts and greedily
devour it, unconscious of its flavoring. This is the one
place in Asuncion where meat and fresh vegetables are for
sale, and the private families and hotel guests are obliged
to partake of it or starve.
</p>

<p>
But few foreign women visit Asuncion; it should be
their paradise because here for a song can be purchased
the ñanduti, the most delicate silk and cotton embroidery
in existence woven by the native women. This wonderful
texture represents much labor and is in great demand.
The <i>guayaba</i> flower is a popular design, a round blossom
with a starlike center. Stuffed alligators and cucurús
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187'>[187]</a></span>
adorn the store windows and live parrots sell for a few
cents apiece. In buying a parrot, one should previously
enlist the services of a native. Birds under one year are
most precious and those with the yellow head command
the highest price. In order to make the old birds appear
wild and hearty, the natives feed them with rum. This
makes them flutter and their antics then create a grand
show off. En voyage a few days later they die of old age
and the innocent purchaser is unaware that rum was used
to produce unnatural activity. It is better to purchase
parrakeets in Buenos Aires because the pick of Paraguay
is exported to the bird stores on the Calle Moreno. At
San Bernardino can be bought lovely egrets and butterfly
wings. Monkeys cannot stand transportation and soon
die.
</p>

<p>
The physicians of Asuncion are poor and but few hold
genuine degrees. Every bowel or stomach complaint that
the patient gets, they are likely to diagnose as appendicitis,
and they are anxious to operate with dirty instruments
which they carry loosely in their pockets. I
know of a case of a woman having a dull pain high up on
her left side which they claimed was appendicitis and
they wanted to operate on her for it, telling her it was a
reflex pain, when in reality it was nothing but a common
fatty tumor.
</p>

<p>
One of the curses in Asuncion and so acknowledged by
the English residents are the missionaries from Australia
classed as the Plymouth Brethren, which belief is akin to
that of the Methodists. No missionaries are needed in
Paraguay. These Plymouth Brethren, numbering two
families, were sent to Asuncion with free transportation
and a monthly salary of twenty pounds to teach religion to
the poor benighted heathen which there does not exist.
They hold services at their pleasure in a room in their houses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188'>[188]</a></span>
to a congregation that scarcely reaches six in number. The
remainder of their time they spend in indolent ease, for a
person in Asuncion can live like a king on one hundred
dollars per month. One of the chief Paraguayan industries
is the manufacture of cigars. The native women
make two classes, the <i>poguazú</i> and <i>pohí</i>. The first mentioned
are long, large, strong cigars which sell at 2½ c.
per half dozen. This is a favorite one with the native
women who invariably have one poked half-way down
their muzzle, the ashy end just protruding. The pohís
are small cigars with outside wrapper grown from Havana
seed. They are more aromatic and sell for 2½ c. a dozen.
The factories made five cigars, that of La Veguera turning
out one named "Don Alfonso" which sells for 120
pesos ($3) for twenty-five, or 12 c. apiece. This same
brand sells in Buenos Aires for 50 c. apiece and is equal
to the best Havanas that sell in the United States for $1
apiece. The ñandeyara guazú is a fine cigar that sells for 30
pesos (75 c.) a hundred. Paraguay is a smoker's paradise
and the advantage of the tobacco is that it never causes
sore spots on the tongue nor any other vocal irritation.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants are extremely lazy, and on the estancias
the men live in indolent ease, their many concubines
doing the real labor. Strangers living in Paraguay
become in time like the natives, taking their siesta at noon
and putting off all work until the morrow. The business
is in the hands of the Spaniards, Germans, and Italians.
There are over five thousand Germans in the republic but
like the Spaniard they are unpopular with the natives.
There is much wealth in Asuncion according to the Paraguayan
standard but very little according to the European
standard. The town teems with millionaires but a
million pesos Paraguayan amounts to only twenty-five
thousand dollars. These people can make a great splurge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189'>[189]</a></span>
and live in great style in Asuncion where food is plentiful
and good, qualifying a luxury. The women of these
people assume great airs. There are only two real millionaires
according to their wealth in North American
currency. One is Saccarello, an Italian estanciero and
the other is Jorba, a Spaniard, who has a general store
and who is an extensive exporter with an office in Barcelona.
Angulo, another exporter and storekeeper, is
wealthy as well as Urrutia and Uguarte, bankers; but
these last named people are not millionaires. For $7500
can be built a palace of a house. Land is cheap all over
the republic. There is a market for all native products
which are lumber, cattle, mandioca, sugar cane, tobacco,
yerba maté, and tannic acid. But little is exported on
account of the scarcity of labor for the men will not work.
What labor there is, is cheap. For example, the old Spaniard
who is bartender, table waiter, floor sweeper, and
general factotum of the Hotel Hispano-Americano only
receives $10 a month, with practically no income from
tips. With this, he supports his English wife and four
children. Poverty in Paraguay is unknown. About
5000 acres of rich soil can be purchased for $10,000.
</p>

<p>
Paraguay is one of the few South American countries
which has iron but as yet it is not exploited, although in
the period of the Five Years' War it furnished material
from which the cannon were manufactured in Asuncion.
The language of the country is Guarani, phonetic, expressive
and rich in vowels. Foreigners learn it easily and it is
the vernacular of all excepting those people dealing with
strangers. The newspaper was formerly published in it
and Lopez was at one time thinking seriously of making
it the official language of the country. Outside of Asuncion
it is essentially spoken throughout the country and
in certain districts Spanish is of no avail.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190'>[190]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Some of the Asuncenas are gems. If the reader of this
work has previously read my <i>South American Travels</i> he
may remember of my stating that I saw in the telegraph
office in Asuncion, working as clerks, two of the most
beautiful girls that I have ever gazed upon. This time
while in the city I returned to the telegraph office ostensibly
to send a message, but in reality to see if the same
maidens were still on the job. The youngest was there, a
marvelous work of God, but three years' lapse of time
had slightly undermined her beauty. Although we had
seen each other but one brief moment before and had met
thousands of people in the interval, recognition was at
once mutual. I told her how beautiful she was, how she
attracted me and how I longed to make her acquaintance.
She reciprocated my attentions, told me that her name
was Marcelina Espinosa and that I had permission to call
on her. This happened on the eve of my departure for
Motto Grosso, and I assured her that when I returned to
Asuncion in the course of two months that I certainly
should avail myself of the pleasure of her kind invitation.
</p>

<p>
Not wishing to seem egotistical in making this statement,
I was not long in Asuncion, before I discovered
that I appealed to Paraguayan womanhood. Oftentimes
of an evening while passing along the residential streets
I would notice women in the act of closing the doors or
the shutters. On seeing me they would desist from this
occupation and regard me longingly and sympathetically
until I had disappeared from sight. At a printing establishment
which had picture postal cards for sale, a fine
looking woman on whose face was depicted latent passions
which only needed encouragement to become a reality,
waited on me. As I paid her for a trivial purchase, she
let her hand linger in mine looking at me appealingly for
reciprocation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191'>[191]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
An old native woman in the market-place admired a
gold ring with jade setting which I always wear as a lucky
stone. She was not content only in admiring it, but she
went through the market and got her friends to come
and look at it. Many of these were comely girls. They
not knowing that I understood a word of Guarani remarked
on its beauty, and then fell to discussing me in
most charming terms.
</p>

<p>
Although most Paraguayans are born out of wedlock,
the inhabitants are not immoral. Like the majority of
Latin Americans they are unmoral because they never had
any morals to begin with. It is quite the thing in Asuncion
for men forty years old and more to have lustful
intentions on twelve-year old girls. Women frequently
marry at fourteen years of age, but men seldom do so
before they are thirty years old. Many women remain
single for there are nine women to every man in Paraguay,
owing to the decimation of the latter in the numerous
revolutions that have taken place, and with such a disproportionate
ratio on the side of the women, it is easy
for the men to satisfy their desires without marriage.
Excepting among the highest social classes virtue among
women has no value and men who are old enough to be
grandfathers lasciviously ogle girls that have scarcely
reached the age of puberty. This great disparity of ages
does not have the evil results that are often the case in
colder countries. The women soon lose their good looks
while the men seldom change until they reach old age.
The girls for generations have been taught to marry men
considerably older than themselves; thus the caned and
bespatted young fops that haunt the cafés and moving
picture shows are obliged to form mesalliances with young
half-breed girls. The latter are too ignorant to make any
objection to being seduced as they have been taught that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192'>[192]</a></span>
it is the natural state of affairs. No matter how unmoral
the people are, a Paraguayan girl is rarely to be found in a
brothel. Many men going by different names are half
brothers, having had the same mother but different fathers.
As in all countries of lax morals, syphilis is rife. But very
few of the inhabitants show outward symptoms of it, for it
is so much inbred in the people that it has lost its virulence.
</p>

<p>
I had met on the train coming from Buenos Aires a
man who was so Teutonic in appearance and in style of his
clothes that I had supposed him to be fresh from Germany.
He sat across from me at the table in the dining car after
leaving Villa Encarnacion, and I was surprised to hear him
answer "Chileno" when the Paraguayan immigration
inspector asked him his nationality. He was the grandson
of a German who had settled in Southern Chile. This
man that I met was about forty years old and is so prominent
in financial circles that his name is famous all over
Southern Chile. He was now on his way to Asuncion to
look over one of the two Paraguayan gunboats which the
government wished to sell in order to obtain sufficient
funds to pay off the army with. If the gunboat suited
him he could have it shipped to Chile and have it remodeled
as a freighter or a passenger ship. His name
for obvious reasons I shall designate as M&mdash;&mdash;.
</p>

<p>
Señor M&mdash;&mdash; was a very entertaining man, had traveled
all over the world, and appeared to have a good knowledge
of sociology. I invited him to the Hispano-Americano
to have dinner with me and he in turn invited me to dine
with him at the Saint-Pierre where he sojourned. We
went a couple of times to the moving picture shows and
to the Belvedere gardens. His discourse was always
of the most moral and elevating character which was a
marked contrast to that of the natives. One night I
suggested that we should take in a vaudeville entertainment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193'>[193]</a></span>
that was being staged at the Belvedere. He agreed
and I went to the Hotel Saint-Pierre to meet him. As it
was a nice evening he suggested that we should walk,
although it was nearly two miles there. Soon after
starting out, a tropical thunder storm, so common to
southern latitudes, came up, and rain fell in such a deluge
that we were obliged to take shelter in a doorway. The
street became a veritable river and owing to the violence
of the downpour the street cars stopped running. Just as
suddenly as the storm had broken, it stopped. It was too
wet to continue walking and as we were trying to arrive
at a decision as to how we could best get to Belvedere, a
little girl about fourteen years walked by. M&mdash;&mdash; noticed
her and straightway walked out of the shelter where
we were standing to say something to her. I supposed
that he had gone to question her about the car service, but
as they conversed at length and as I saw her smile, I
thought I would walk up to see what the joke was. Imagine
my astonishment when I heard M&mdash;&mdash;, whom I had
supposed to be so moral and before whom I was always
choosing my language, in conversation with this child
inducing her to allow him to seduce her. My astonishment
was still greater when she accepted his approaches
and walked off with him in the direction of the Hotel
Saint-Pierre where we had just come from.
</p>

<p>
About two o'clock the next afternoon as I was returning
to my hotel from a walk, I saw M&mdash;&mdash; on the marble
stairs of the Hispano-Americano offering pecuniary
inducements to any of the old women (none were under
fifty) who daily sat on the bottom steps displaying <i>ñanduti</i>
embroidery for sale, if one would come up to a bedroom
for a half hour. M&mdash;&mdash; did not make such a hit
with these <i>ñanduti</i> women as he did with the little native
girl, for none would accept his terms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194'>[194]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
I upbraided M&mdash;&mdash; roundly for his actions telling him
that he should be ashamed of himself for making such
propositions to young girls. "Es costumbre" ("It's the
custom") he would answer, and that was all the excuse he
could give for his actions. He informed me that he had
discovered that the Paraguayan native was much like
the Chilean of the lower stratum, and that for a few pesos
he could "fix" any policeman or irate parent in Asuncion
the same way as he could at his home town in Chile.
This man thought he was doing nothing unnatural or to
be ashamed of. I later found out that M&mdash;&mdash; was telling
the truth as far as it was "costumbre," for Chile and
Paraguay have among their respected citizens, men who
emulate the same acts as M&mdash;&mdash; and are not arrested for
them, while here in North America they would be safely
behind the bars of some institution for doing the same
thing.
</p>

<p>
About twenty miles northwest of Asuncion is the
entrancing Lake Ypacara-i, twelve miles long by five
broad. Its shores are dotted with the summer residences
of the Asuncene aristocracy. San Bernardino is a German
colony and is the most delectable place in all Paraguay.
It is reached by train from Asuncion to Areguá,
another summer resort where cars are changed. A couple
of miles from Areguá is a station named Kendall, whence
one can cross by launch to San Bernardino, where are
located the Hotel del Lago and the Hotel Rasmussen,
the first mentioned being the best. The scenery is
beautifully pastoral and brings to one's mind Virgil's
<i>Bucolics</i>, for here like the scenery he described in his
immortal work, shepherd boys watch their ovine flocks
playing melodies on slender reeds.

<h2>
CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="s08">TO THE SOURCE OF THE PARAGUAY RIVER</span>
</h2>

<p>
Strolling down to the dock one day I saw a sign stating
that the steamer <i>Asuncion</i> would be sailing for Corumbá,
Brazil that same evening at six o'clock. I inquired how
long it took to reach its destination, and upon being told
four days, bought a ticket. I once had the misfortune of
being a passenger on the S. S. <i>Asuncion</i> when it ran
aground on a mud bank in the Paraná River and was
moored twenty-six hours in midstream. It is one of the
older ships of the Mihanovich Line and formerly plied
between Buenos Aires and Asuncion. It has no salon and
the guests are obliged to sit in the dining room. Two
other steamship companies run to Corumbá. The Brazilian
Lloyd with fortnightly service and the Vierci Line
owned in Asuncion. The latter boats and those of the
Mihanovich Line touch at all the river ports, while the
only stop besides Asuncion that the Brazilian Lloyd makes
in Paraguay is Villa Concepcion.
</p>

<p>
It became dark soon after sailing, and at nine o'clock we
tied up to the dock at Villa Hayes, a small town on the
Chaco side of the river and named in honor of Rutherford
Hayes, ex-president of the United States, who was the
arbiter in a boundary dispute between Argentina and
Paraguay. He rendered a decision in favor of the latter
country. A high wind blew all night, and without it
the heat would have been nearly unbearable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196'>[196]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The next morning when I awoke I saw that the sides of
the river were bounded by a tropical forest. The steamer
hugged the east bank for here, the river a mile wide at this
point, was the deepest. Beautiful racemose clusters of
red lilies grew from tall slender stalks; from water oaks
were suspended air plants and purple orchids; lianas
ropelike, hung from the tree tops to the ground. At ten
o'clock the steamer anchored off the mouth of a small
stream named the Cuarepoti up which, a mile or so, is the
settlement of Rosario. Several rowboats came up with
passengers. About two o'clock in the afternoon, the wide
and swiftly flowing Jejuy River is reached on which is
the now dismantled fort of San Pedro. The Paraguay
River widens out and is filled with many islets, some of
them large. The forest had receded and the swampy
land was flooded; from the islets in the marshes rose
groves of hiaty palms and the lagoons were covered by the
wonderful aquatic plant, the Victoria Regia. The leaves
of this plant are round and flat, and they resemble huge
floating dishes. Where the edges are turned, turtles crawl
up on the leaves and bask in the sun. Besides the Victoria
Regia there are lotus plants and I saw a reed resembling
papyrus. As the steamer passes, crocodiles flop in the
river with a heavy thud and hissing ñacaninás crawl into
the dank undergrowth.
</p>

<p>
At ten o'clock that night, Villa Concepcion was reached
where we remained nearly two hours. I stopped at that
hellfire town for three days on my return trip and regretted
it. I imagine that in the winter it is a pleasant enough
place as far as climate goes, but at the time of my visit it
was fierce. The rains had swollen the river, which had
overflowed its banks and practically left the town an
island in a fresh water sea from which emerged tree
trunks. It was hotter than the fictitious Hades and a low
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197'>[197]</a></span>
gray vapor shrouded everything from sight mornings and
evenings. The sun came out torrid several times a day,
alternated by thunder showers. Bugs, reptiles, and
insects were galore.
</p>

<p>
Villa Concepcion is the fourth city in Paraguay in
population, although the unincorporated place of Luque
is larger. Its estimated population is 15,600 although I
think one half these figures would be nearer the mark.
In importance, it is the second town in the republic for in
the hinterland are sugar mills to which a railroad extends.
The terminus is Horqueta, about forty miles inland. Concepcion
is built on the left bank of the Paraguay River
which here is a mile wide, and facing the town is an island.
A few miles south of it, the Ipané River empties into the
Paraguay.
</p>

<p>
The Ipané gives the name to Concepcion's main street,
a miserable thoroughfare of one story brick and wood
buildings plastered over. There are, however, a few
buildings of size on this street and on the other principal
street, whose name is Aquidabán. A ditch runs along
each side of Calle Ipané, and there is one in the middle of
Calle Aquidabán. These are crossed by planks being
thrown across them. The water had washed some of the
planks away which made the streets impassable. Strange
to say, Villa Concepcion boasts of one automobile, a Ford.
As in Asuncion the market-place is of interest, although it
is on a much smaller scale than that of the capital. The
main breathing place is named Plaza de Libertad from the
Statue of Liberty which graces its center. It stands on an
octagonal base with funeral wreaths in bas-relief, while on
a ledge on top of the base are perched eight cement lions.
The allegorical goddess reposes her hand upon a shield.
Her picture, taken from this statue adorns the Paraguayan
jubilee postage stamps of a few years back.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_198' name='Page_198'>[198]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Sometime during the night that we left Villa Concepcion,
we passed by the mouth of the Aquidabán River.
It was up its valley that Francisco Solano Lopez retreated
with the remnants of his brave army in 1870 closely
pursued by the Brazilian cavalry, and it was at the base
of a mountain named Cerro Corá at the headwaters of the
Aquidabán, many miles distant in the tropical forest that
he met his death, being pierced through the body by the
lances of the enemy. Among his retinue was his mistress,
Madame Lynch and some of her henchwomen. Strange
to say when they were captured they were found clad
in silken dresses of the latest Parisian creation and
wearing low ballroom slippers, and this in the midst of the
deepest imaginable water-soaked jungle miles away from
civilization.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning we reached the village of San
Salvador with its beef-packing plant. The <i>saladero</i> is a
stock company composed of North American and German
capital. They slaughter the long-horned native cattle,
which are cheap here. At the outbreak of the World War,
the British Government ordered from them $240,000
worth of canned beef which was delivered and consumed by
the British Army. This beef is still unpaid for. Great
Britain refuses to pay on account of the majority of the
shares of stock being held by Germans. By this refusal
it is also hurting the interests of the North Americans
who have stock in the company, which amounts to nearly
one half. This defalcation of payment has put the
saladeria on the hummer and it is now in the hands of a
receiver.
</p>

<p>
At the time of my visit, the whole town of San Salvador
was wrought up by an incident that had occurred the
day before, and which was the only topic of conversation.
The foremen of the saladero pay off the laborers with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199'>[199]</a></span>
time checks which they present at the company office
for currency. A native forged one of these checks and
made such a poor job of it that he was refused payment
and threatened with arrest. Angered, he whipped out a
big knife, long and thin with a razor edge, with the intentions
of annihilating the manager, a North American.
The latter grabbed a revolver which scared the Paraguayan,
who started to run down the road.
</p>

<p>
Leaning against a fence post, with his hand on the rail,
stood another North American, a mere boy, and a friend
of the manager who had arrived from the United States,
but three days before on a visit, and not at all connected
with the company. The route of the fleeing native led
by this young chap, and as he ran by him, he raised his
arm and aimed a blow with his knife at the young fellow's
hand, which was so powerful that it completely severed
it at the wrist. The Paraguayan was caught and lodged
in a temporary jail. The next morning, the day of my
arrival, he was to be taken in a rowboat to Villa Concepcion
to be tried.
</p>

<p>
The sequel to this event which I heard on my return
trip was as follows: His guards not relishing the long
rowboat trip to Concepcion, for it would take them several
hard days rowing upstream on the return journey, pitched
the native overboard in midstream. A few bubbles came
up as a <i>saurian</i> closed its jaws upon him, and a red tinge
rose to the surface of the river.
</p>

<p>
From San Salvador northward, occasional round hills
are met. The first of these is Itapucumi (sleeping giant),
two hours above the settlement. Here the Paraguay
River makes a great bend and narrows to one-half mile in
width. It is studded with green islands, some of them
floating. Puerto Max, where there is another saladeria,
is stopped at and farther on, we passed the stockade
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200'>[200]</a></span>
of an old penal settlement. At dusk we passed another
cluster of isolated hills on the east bank; the west bank is
now a great dismal swamp. The River Apá is reached
which is the boundary line between Paraguay and the
Brazilian state of Matto Grosso. We now have Brazil
on the right and the Paraguayan Chaco on the left.
</p>

<p>
Next to Amazonas, Matto Grosso is the largest state
in Brazil. Its area is 539,092 square miles and its population
is estimated at about 245,000. Only three South
American republics (excepting Brazil, of which this state
is a part), Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru have a larger
area than Matto Grosso. It occupies the very center of
South America and its capital, Cuyabá, is more geographically
situated in the center of that continent than any
other town. The main industry of Matto Grosso is stock
raising, there being over 2,500,000 head of cattle within its
confines. In this respect it is third among the Brazilian
states, Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Geraes outranking
it. The name given to the native cattle is <i>cuyabára</i>; they
are noted for their viciousness, are red and unlike the Paraguayan
breed, are short-horned. A saladero or saladeria
(the name for the whole establishment), is in Brazil named
a <i>charqueada</i> and there are several of these in the state
besides a factory where beef extract is made at São Luiz.
The eastern part of the state is a plateau with several
high ranges of hills; the western part is a forest; great
areas being flooded at certain seasons on account of poor
drainage. The word Matto Grosso means "big forest,"
<i>matto</i> being a covering of trees and bushes. Besides
stock raising, rubber plays an important part of the state's
industries but this latter is confined to the northwestern
region where is located the Madeira-Mamoré Railroad.
The only other railroad in the state is a few miles of track
outside of Corumbá. It will form part of the Mogyana
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201'>[201]</a></span>
system when completed, as the present intentions are to
connect Corumbá with São Paulo. There was a telegraph
line to Cuyabá and to Corumbá, via Goyaz but it is frequently
out of commission. It takes three weeks of travel
to reach Cuyabá from Rio de Janeiro and this trip is made
by the Paraná and Paraguay rivers.
</p>

<p>
On the third morning we reached an estancia, the
settlement of Porto Murtinho with its swampy background.
There were numerous wild ducks and plover to
be seen. This is the starting place for egret hunters;
many of these birds abounding in the back country.
Shortly after leaving the place, two hills rise on each side
of the river. The one on the right being so much higher
that the eminence on the left appears low. These are respectively
Pao d'Assucar and Fecho dos Morras. Further
up and on another hill is the Brazilian Fort Barranco-branco
and beyond it on an eminence on the Paraguayan
side is Fort Olimpo. In the afternoon, we stop at
Puerto Ledo, Puerto Esperanza, Puerto 14 de Mayo, and
Puerto Boggiani, all in Paraguay, and at dark reach a
place where the river widens into a lake which is named
Bahia Negra. This is formed by the junction of the
Paraguay and the Otuquis rivers. The last mentioned
stream being commonly called Rio Negro. We here left
Paraguayan territory as the Brazilian boundary line is
arrived at on the left bank. In the night we passed Fort
Coimbra and when I awoke the following morning there
were hills on the west bank. The river had narrowed
down to one quarter of a mile. In the afternoon we
passed Fort Albuquerque and late at night arrived at
the wretched but lively city of Corumbá, commercial
center of Matto Grosso and the synonym of lawlessness
and disorder.
</p>

<p>
This vile town with its diseased population and a jumping-off
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202'>[202]</a></span>
place of commercial riffraff, has a population of
nearly twenty thousand inhabitants. It is built on the
high banks of the west shore of the Paraguay River. The
water is six feet deep at the docks when the river is low but
the project has long been contemplated of deepening the
channel so that vessels drawing twenty feet can anchor
there. Nineteen hundred and eighty-six miles from the
mouth of the La Plata River, it is the head of navigation
for large boats and it has an immense trade, considering
the size of the place, on account of its being the sole distributing
point for southern Matto Grosso. The tortuous
muddy road leads up the bank to the town which is
well built with morgue-like edifices. The structures are
mostly of one story and many have semicircular round-top
windows, which are uncommon in all South American
countries excepting Brazil, where they are characteristic.
The Hotel Paris, where I stopped, was nothing at all
like Paris and the slovenly waiters had a cutthroat
appearance.
</p>

<p>
Corumbá has a widely established reputation for disorder.
It is so far from the Federal capital of Brazil that
it might be anywhere else in the world as far as the
inhabitants having any fear from that quarter of punishments
for their misdeeds. Matto Grosso is run very
much as if it were an independent country, and on account
of the low caliber of the native potentates and politicians,
lawlessness is rampant. Nearly every man in the city
carries a long thin razor-edged knife and many of the
population give testimony of a one-time fight with this
kind of weapon by the scars to be seen on their visages.
There are some whose nose has been severed and others
who are minus an ear. There is but little public safety
there from murder or robbery or both on the back streets
after nightfall. The natives like to pretend that they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203'>[203]</a></span>
are atheists but I have noticed that this same tribe either
slink away in a hangdog fashion when they see a priest
approaching or else are quick to drop on their knees and
make the sign of the cross.
</p>

<p>
As to industry, besides having a charqueada, Corumbá
has a brewery and the Ladario naval arsenal. The town, I
think, has a good future on account of its central location.
The surrounding country is swampy so there is apt to be
malaria but otherwise it is fairly free from epidemics.
Most of the inhabitants are syphilitic or are afflicted with
other diseases due to lax morals. The climate, though
hot, is better than that of Villa Concepcion, and it is
doubtful if in the summer months the thermometer rises
as high as it does in Asuncion.
</p>

<p>
The 280-mile trip from Corumbá to Cuyabá is made in
anywheres from four days to a week and one half on small
steamers of fifty tons. At their very best, they make an
average of seventy miles a day of twelve hours as they tie
up to the bank at night. These boats, owned locally
and also by the Vierci Brothers of Asuncion, carry twenty
first-class and fifty third-class passengers. Since the
traffic is heavy, it is necessary for the traveler to board
the steamer the day before to obtain a convenient place
to sling his hammock and then hire some roustabout to
watch it for him. Otherwise somebody else would be apt
to remove it. If a person waited until the morning of
departure before slinging his hammock, he would find all
the suitable places occupied. It is impossible to sleep
in one of the few cabins which have bunks on account of
the heat from the ship's engines combined with that of the
atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
Corumbá is 384 feet above the sea level; Cuyabá is 401;
thus the drop in 280 miles is only 17 feet or 7/10 of an
inch to a mile. The swampy pasture which is entered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204'>[204]</a></span>
and which continues until the day Cuyabá is reached is
one of the hell holes of this earth. This immense marsh,
which is 350 miles across in an east to west line, extends
into Bolivia and is a flat piece of ground grown to marsh
grass in which countless herds of semi-wild cattle fatten.
There are occasional stunted trees whose penurious shade
affords the sole protection against the powerful sun and
blinding rays. In the afternoon of the first day, we
passed a few huts named Tres Barras and at night pulled
up to shore at a cape formed by the confluence of the
Cuyabá and Paraguay rivers. On account of the low
drop in altitudes, there is such poor drainage that branches
of the Paraguay and Cuyabá shoot out in all directions,
forming numerous channels in a great delta. The Paraguay
is considerably wider than the Cuyabá and has a
much greater volume of water as well as a swifter current.
It is navigable for small vessels as far as São Luiz de
Caceres about 250 miles farther up.
</p>

<p>
The whole trip was uneventful through a most monotonous
country. About a day and one half before we
reached the capital, another river flowing from the northeast
and about the same size as the Cuyabá entered it.
This river was named the São Lourenço although I understand
that the natives are in the habit of giving this same
name even to the Cuyabá River below its confluence.
The heat was fierce but strange to say there were but few
mosquitoes. It is most peculiar that of the whole La Plata
river system mosquitoes are most abundant in the delta of
the Paraná River between Rosario and Buenos Aires, and
that up in the tropics of northern Paraguay and Matto
Grosso where one would think they would be most likely
to be found, they are noticeable by their absence. In
other parts of Matto Grosso where the rivers belong to the
Amazonian watershed, I understand they are legion. At
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205'>[205]</a></span>
night fireflies came out in bunches and the swampy plain
was resonant with the croaking of frogs. One afternoon
nearly a week after leaving Corumbá, hills appeared on
the right which took on the form of low mountains and
these continued in view until the capital in the midst of
a thickly settled country was approached.</p>

<p>
Cuyabá is an old city of one-story houses, strongly built,
and boasts of wide grass-grown streets, and a spacious
shadeless plaza on which faces the cathedral. It is said
to have been founded a couple of hundred years ago by
Portuguese prospectors who started out from São Paulo.
During the eighteenth century it was the center of the
placer district and the headquarters of the miners who
equipped themselves here for their trips to the remote
parts of Brazil and what is now Bolivia. It was a lively
place in those days, but a hundred years ago became
decadent until recently when the cattle industry took a
boom. In the last decade it has picked up, and its population
to-day numbers not far from twenty thousand.
It is the seat of a bishopric, is electric lighted (on the main
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206'>[206]</a></span>
street), and is in telegraphic communication (sometimes)
with Rio de Janeiro. The Mogyana Railroad system from
São Paulo is expected to extend here shortly which will be
a great benefit to the place, as well as facilitate exportation.
In many respects Cuyabá is a fine city although
it falls far below the standard of a North American city of
the same size. It has many fine residences, and an air of
proudness and of aristocracy enthralls it. It is the residence
of quite a few persons of wealth, and I am told that among
its inhabitants are three millionaires, who by the way prefer
to live in Paris and in Lisbon rather than in the stagnant
town where they first saw the light of day. Cuyabá is very
nearly in the center of South America and it seems incredible
that in this region so little known, the surrounding
country is so thickly populated and well cultivated. It is
said that three quarters of the entire population of the tremendously
large State of Matto Grosso inhabit a radius
of fifty miles from Cuyabá as the center. The Chapada
Mountains to the east rise to a height of 2733 feet. Cool
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207'>[207]</a></span>
breezes blow from the plateau of which they form the
western barriers, causing the temperature not to be over-oppressive.
There is but little malaria away from the
river; the diseases common to the country seem to be
beri-beri and leprosy. Many people afflicted with the
last-named malady are found in all parts of Matto Grosso,
but not so much so in the cities as in the country. This
form of leprosy is not supposed to be contagious. Many
of its victims also have elephantiasis.</p>

<p>
I was told that the springs that form the source of the
Paraguay River were about four days' horseback ride
distant, and as it has always been my ambition to gaze
upon them, I decided to visit them. I had already seen
the source of the Amazon, and considered that my travels
in South America would be far from complete if I
failed to also see the place whence the second greatest
water system in that continent took its source. I had
seen ancient woodcuts of the source of the river, the one
which defined itself in my mind being from a drawing in
the works of Dr. Martius, 1832. It depicts a flat, grassy
plain in which is a pool, of irregular shape, about a stone's
throw wide by the same dimension long, encircled by
sixty-three hiaty palms with slender trunks. Martius'
works are long out of print but a copy of his woodcut
is reproduced on page 60 of <i>Album Gráfico de la República
del Paraguay</i> by Arsenio Lopez Decoud, Buenos Aires,
1911. Many times during the long winter nights in my
Northern Michigan home I have sat in front of the fireplace
and gazed at this woodcut, always hoping that
it would be my fortune to gaze upon the original. I
became obsessed with this fixed idea in Buenos Aires,
which was augmented in Asuncion, and it was solely
for this reason that I went first to Corumbá and thence to
Cuyabá, getting nearer and nearer the goal of my quest.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208'>[208]</a></span>
In Cuyabá I was told that the source lay not many kilometers
from the main traveled road from there to Diamantino,
and was easily accessible. Little did I think
that in seeing it, the trip would be responsible for the loss
of a life.
</p>

<p>
The second day after my arrival in Cuyabá I met a
German commercial traveler named Huber who represented
a Rosario importing house of harvesting machinery.
He was bound to Diamantino and having heard that
I had the same destination, suggested that we should make
the trip together as he had but little use for the natives,
thinking that they might murder and rob him en route.
I agreed but said that in case he accompanied me he
would have to deviate from his route for a day to see the
source of the Paraguay. He said that it was a lot of
nonsense and that I could see these springs on my way
back. I replied that I had no object to go to Diamantino
excepting to rest a day or so after having seen the springs,
and that having come so far to see them I would do so
anyhow, regardless of whether he would accompany me or
not. Huber became disgruntled and told me he would let
me know that night whether he would go to the unnecessary
trouble to view this "dummheit" as he called it. He
spent most of the day interviewing the foreign element
of Cuyabá inquiring if anyone else in the place had the
intention of setting out for Diamantino within the next
couple of days. His inquiries evidently were met with
negative answers for as I was about to retire he came to
my room and stated that he was ready to set out with me
the following morning.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning we set out with two guides which
we had engaged through the medium of the Italian consular
agent and followed a cart road along the east bank of
the Cuyabá River, which was becoming so narrow that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209'>[209]</a></span>
one could easily heave a good-sized stone across it. At
noon we stopped at a miserable leper-infested place
named Guia, the center of a stock country, and by nightfall
reached the hamlet of Brotas. Not wishing to share
my bed with the vermin that infested the <i>botequim</i> which
went by the name of hotel, I hung my hammock between
two trees in the rear of the establishment.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the second day we arrived at dusk at
the large village of Rosario da Cuyabá, finely situated on
a height of land on the west bank of the Cuyabá River
which we forded below the town. This Rosario is at
the foot of some low mountains and is a pleasant place
although but a wreck of its former self. It was once
quite a placer center, and some diamonds were found here
that are now among the crown jewels of Austria. There
is a fairly comfortable four-bedroom hotel where I spent
the night, but got but little sleep on account of the hooting
of an owl in a nearby bush. The hotel is owned by a
Spaniard who has resided for over thirty years in the
country. In the meantime he took one trip back to
Spain but returned as he preferred Matto Grosso. Rosario
is 998 feet above sea level, being 597 feet higher than
Cuyabá. I think its population is in excess of two thousand.
There is a project on hand to inaugurate an
electric lighting plant and to build a charqueada.
</p>

<p>
From here to Diamantino it is a hard two days' ride if
one wishes to visit the source of the Paraguay owing to
the detour of about six hours. The road that wound up
the low mountains named the Serra Azul is no better than
a cow path, and was extremely rocky and slippery. The
shrubbery is very thick and is covered with thorns, although
there are no large trees. Occasionally a clearing
is met where languid natives have attempted to grow
enough legumes for their meager wants, together with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210'>[210]</a></span>
omnipresent sugarcane patch which supplies them with
enough <i>cachaca</i> for their frequent debauches. Their
huts are painted pink or white and can be seen from a
great distance, at which point of vantage they always
appear at their best. At one of these fazendas, as the
farms are called, we stopped for the night. A small stream
but a couple of inches deep, filled with pebbles and where
pools were formed with watercress, trickled through the
fazenda. It served the farmer with his supply of drinking
water, water for his stock, the washing place of his clothes,
as well as the washing place for the feet of his numerous
offspring. On each side of the rivulet were trees and
from them we slung our hammocks. One end of my hammock
was tied to a tree on the left bank, the other end
to a tree on the right bank; if the rope had broken or
come loose, I would have dropped into the creek. The
hospitality of the inhabitants of the tropics of South
America is in marked contrast to the stinginess and mean
actions of those people that inhabit the Andean uplands.
Nowhere in Paraguay or Brazil have I been subjected to
the discourtesy and suspicion that greet every traveler
in the mountains of Peru or Bolivia. This particular
fazendado not only insisted upon helping our guides cook
the meals, but also added canned goods which he had
bought in Cuyabá, and refused to accept any pecuniary
remuneration therefor. The next morning he accompanied
us for a few miles on his pony and also went to much
trouble to point out to us where the best paths were.
</p>

<p>
From the top of the Serra Azul near where the fazenda
was situated, a broad valley was seen to open out at our
feet. It was swampy, and was carpeted with marsh
grasses and rushes which were yellow. To the northwest
the sun reflected on a tortuous silver thread which was
the river. In several places the stream lost itself behind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211'>[211]</a></span>
islets of mangrove while in front of us it was barely perceptible
on account of the tules in the bog which screened
it from view. Our guides pointed out what seemed to be a
group of palmettos several kilometers to the east and
informed us that there were the springs from which the
Paraguay had its source. Leaving the cart track we
galloped over the oozing sod of black muck at the risk of
getting our horses stalled in the mire. Great blue herons,
startled at our approach, rose from the tules, emitting shrill
cries, and flew away to a place of safety, the noise of their
flapping wings sounding like that made by a person beating
a rug. Near the tops of some trees resembling water
oaks we observed some egrets, but unfortunately they were
at too great a distance to bring down with a revolver shot.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of the source of the Paraguay River
was much different in details from Dr. Martius' woodcut,
yet in general aspects it had quite a resemblance. The
drawing that I saw was made nearly a century ago, and
during that lapse of time the features of the immediate
landscape may have changed. It may have been that
the drawing in Martius' work was made from memory,
away from the spot, and that not being present at the pool
when the drawing was made, his memory was not accurate.
Some of the hiaty palms may in the meantime have died
and rotted. It was impossible for me to photograph it on
account of the noonday shadowless sun, but I made a rough
pencil sketch of the scenery.
</p>

<p>
Picture to yourself a great bog of yellow rushes waving
in the sweltering noonday heat with no trees in sight,
excepting a nearly perfect circle of eleven hiaty palms;
inscribe in this circle a pool of dark steel-blue transparent
water. This pool is about 150 feet in diameter, and on its
surface float several gigantic pan-like leaves of Victoria
Regia. From where I stood I saw that the pool abounded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212'>[212]</a></span>
with small fishes. Looking into the water, I saw several
feet beneath the surface something that appeared to be
a rocky ledge. At its side and beneath it from which
bubbles constantly rose was a black hole of Stygian darkness.
This I conjectured was the main spring. On a
branch of one of the palm trees perched an owl, the only
living thing in sight excepting ourselves and our horses.
I was seized with a desire to take a plunge and a swim in
this pond, the zenith of my quest and the goal of many
years' thoughts. Yet I had the feeling that this harmless-looking
water might conceal some reptile, an alligator or
giant turtle, so I quickly gave up the idea, but lying on my
belly I gulped down several large swallows of the water,
which sad to relate was not as cool as I had imagined
it to be and also had a rank taste as of decaying vegetable
matter.
</p>

<p>
The water flowing from the pool does not take any
definite bed, but at first spreads out over quite an area, a
few inches deep, between the thousands of marshy islets,
mere detached tufts of sod but a few feet wide. A quarter
of a mile below the pool the numerous channels unite into
two watercourses, which at a short distance farther converge
into a single creek. This creek is but a few feet
wide, and is clear and clean, a remarkable phenomenon
on account of the muddy swamp which it traverses.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the pool we made for the northern horizon
defined by a height of land resembling low hills, but had
some difficulty on account of the horses continually
stumbling and tripping themselves on the roots of a species
of creeper that had white blossoms and which covered the
landscape at the edge of the marsh. After an hour's ride
we reached the hills and came upon a distinct cattle path
which wound through a jungle and finally brought us out
on a cart road.

</p>

<p>
At the pool Huber never dismounted from his pony,
but sat leaning over in his saddle resting his head on his
hand. I asked him why he did not get down but beyond
muttering a few words about "such nonsense" he neither
said nor did anything. Several times on the ride from the
pool to the hills he complained of having a headache, and
although I gave him a couple of acetphenetidin tablets
they did him no good. He became feverish and said he
felt as if he were burning up. He gradually became worse,
and his pupils narrowed down to the size of a pin head
while his eyes began to shine like coals. It was with
difficulty that he kept his saddle, and the last few miles
into Diamantino he had to be propped into position by his
guide.
</p>

<p>
Diamantino, whose name should not be confused with
the flourishing mining-center of Diamantina in the state
of Minas Geraes, is a town of about three thousand inhabitants
built on the side of a red earth hill but a short distance
to the north of the Paraguay River, here a few rods
wide. From a distance it resembles Tallahassee on account
of the red color of the soil, and the similarity of
their respective townsites. It is one of the oldest towns in
central Brazil. Formerly it was important in the mining
annals of the country on account of gold and diamonds
having been discovered in its vicinity, but mining has long
since played out, and it is only important commercially at
the present time through the exportation of vanilla beans.
It is also the starting place for laborers to the rubber district
in the forests of the north and northwest. Diamantino
is at the base of the great central plateau of Brazil,
which extends eastward into Goyaz, its limits being
defined by the Serra Azul. The latter is the watershed
between the Amazon and the La Plata river systems.
Beyond these mountains is a vast impenetrable forest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_215' name='Page_215'>[215]</a></span>
inhabited by Indians. The proximity is evident by the
great number of members of this race, which I believe
exceeds the white population of the village. But a day's
journey northward, I understand, is the town of Porto
Velho on the Arinos River which farther on becomes the
Tapajos, the latter being the boundary line of the extensive
States of Amazonas and Para; the Tapajos finally
flows into the Amazon at Santarem.
</p>

<p>
Diamantino is one of the most funereal towns imaginable.
Its houses are neatly whitewashed, but the absence of
panes in the windows gives the impression of tombs.
The doors are like black holes in a vault. The streets are
wide and are grown to grass on which horses graze; the
lawns of the better-class houses are set back in rank gardens
enclosed by walls which have pillars at the gates.
The whole impression is that of a country cemetery.
</p>

<p>
The three inns of the place, if such they can be called,
run more to botequim (barroom) than to looking after the
culinary welfare and lodging of their guests. A rubber
train had just entered the town; the laborers had just been
paid off and were now riotously and in good humor making
the streets and botequims resound with their merriment.
They were fast filling up on <i>piraty cachaca</i>, a fiery rumlike
liquid made from sugar cane. A glass of this beverage
will make an ordinary man "fall under the table" and
it is so cheap that it is within the reach of all. On it a
man can get one of the cheapest jags known, and like a few
other intoxicants it goes down like oil. Only the peasants
indulge in it, although it can be obtained in the better-class
botequims of Rio de Janeiro. If a well-dressed
stranger should stroll into a café in Rio and ask for some
of it, the waiter would be apt to look at him in astonishment,
wondering what sort of a common fellow he was
and how he got his fine clothes, for it is the drink of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216'>[216]</a></span>
lower stratum of society. It is kept on the boats of the
Brazilian Lloyd; at Montevideo Brazilian roustabouts
swim out to them, buy the beverage, and in a drunken
stupor have to be rowed ashore.
</p>

<p>
At the mediocre and filthy inn which was the best of the
three at Diamantino, where I obtained a lodging no
better than a hen coop, I tried to get the best room in the
place for Huber who was now so sick that he could not
stand. The landlord gruffly remarked that his place was
no hospital, and would not take him in. Watching over
him, I sent the guides to the other two places but they
likewise refused to shelter him. Somebody suggested
that the priest might find a habitation for him, and upon
my instructions set out to find that worthy, who presently
arrived in a semi-state of inebriation. The holy man,
with filthy robes and an unshaven countenance, scrutinized
Huber minutely through his bleary eyes, and in a
sottish voice said he could be taken to the end house in the
village where upon his recommendation and for about
thirty thousand reis ($7.50) he would receive "everything
that was to be desired." The price was terribly
exorbitant, but owing to the condition the commercial
traveler was in, there was no time to argue, so we set off
to the place indicated, the two guides carrying him, while
the drunken priest, myself, and what seemed to be half
of the male population of Diamantino followed. An old
woman, toothless and humped, with the eternal black cigar
between her lips, discolored with nicotine, came to an
aperture which served as the door and gesticulating
frantically refused admission. The priest called her aside,
and said something to her which we could not hear, but it
evidently appeased her for she came back saying that it
would be all right for him to stay there provided she was
paid in advance. I was on the point of accepting the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217'>[217]</a></span>
offer when a tall, handsome man in uniform appeared,
and asked what the rumpus was about. A hundred voices
tried to answer at the same time. He motioned them to
be silent, and heard me out. No sooner had I stopped
speaking than the crowd again began to speak. He ordered
them to stop, and addressing me said that he was the
chief of police as well as the mayor of the town, and that
his house was at our disposal gratis. I accepted his kind
offer, much to the dismay of the priest and toothless hag
who were now begging me to let Huber stay with them.
</p>

<p>
The two guides, who had laid the German down with a
coat under his head as a pillow in the shade of a wall,
picked him up and we set out toward the mayor's residence,
but a short distance away. The crowd started to follow,
but the mayor with some harsh oaths ordered them away.
They all dispersed excepting a curious few who eyed us
from a distance. The mayor's house was a long one-story
building facing a common grown to grass and milkweed.
It had in front a wide tile-paved veranda whose
heavy roof was supported by square pillars. On this
veranda were benches where the family sat evenings, and
where the functionary entertained his guests. The room
in which he ordered Huber placed was tile paved, high,
and cool, with two windows, one of them at the side nearly
covered with vines. In it was an iron bedstead, a couple
of chairs, a table, and a wash basin. All the front windows
of the house had vertical iron bars. The mayor, a
perfect gentleman, sent a boy whom I imagined to be his
son for a doctor while he invited me to be seated on a
bench and chat with him till the medico arrived. He was
particular to inquire when and how Huber had been taken
sick, as he said he did not care to have anybody in his
place who had a contagious disease.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was slow in coming, so slow that in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218'>[218]</a></span>
meantime Huber had become delirious. He took his
temperature, looked grave, and sent a halfbreed servant
away to soak some towels and rags in cold water, which
when she returned he ordered her to place on Huber's
head and change every few minutes for fresh ones. There
is no ice in Diamantino, and the <i>olla</i> from which the
water had been poured had been standing all the afternoon
in the sun, consequently it was not cool enough to suit the
physician. He gave instructions for more ollas to be
filled, and as night had come on, to be left on the porch in
front of the room in which the patient lay.
</p>

<p>
When the doctor came out, he sat on the bench between
the mayor and me, and informed us that Huber had a sunstroke,
and that it was doubtful if he would live. "Anyhow,"
he said, "if he recovers, he will have to remain
here for weeks before he is well. He shouldn't have
come here in the first place. My opinion is that he
won't survive twenty-four hours longer." I returned
to the botequim where I lodged for dinner, although the
mayor was insistent that I should dine with him. I
excused myself; saying that I had things to attend to and
that I would return later on to see how Huber was getting
on. "He will get on all right if human agencies can help,
but in this case they are of little avail. I have seen such
cases before," were his parting words to me, as I turned
up the moonlit street towards the middle of the town
from which shouts and ribald laughter emanating from
the drunken rubber men were audible in the otherwise
sleepy town.
</p>

<p>
At the botequim where I roomed there was an orgy
going on. Most of the rubber men were soused and our
two guides were rapidly filling up. Rum, gin, and brandy
were spilled all over the room, on the tables, on the chairs,
and on the floor. A couple of bums lay in a corner of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219'>[219]</a></span>
room and one on a soap box, his feet dangling over it
into space. The brutal-appearing ruffian who was the
landlord was his own best customer yet he was intent
enough on business to charge two prices, one to the badly
drunk individuals, and a cheaper one to those in a lesser
maudlin state. I was hungry but as it was impossible
to eat in this barroom, in which on other occasions meals
were served, I repaired to the shed which served as a
kitchen and asked if anything to eat could be had. Two
slatternly halfbreed female servants informed me that
in a few minutes dinner would be served. I waited for
over half an hour and was so impatient with hunger that I
was at my wits' end, when the youngest of the two approached
me and whispered that the proprietor had the
keys to the storeroom in his pocket and that he would
beat her if she disturbed him. Disgusted I set out to buy
some canned goods to sup on at one of the stores which
combine the selling of groceries with that of light hardware
and dry goods, when I felt a pull at my sleeve and looking
around saw the same halfbreed standing there as if she
had something to tell me.
</p>

<p>
"I hope the <i>senhor</i> does not want me to sleep with him
to-night," she whispered to my great astonishment;
"Manoel is here from the rubber country, and if he finds it
out he will kill me. Manoel is my fellow and he is crazy
jealous over me."
</p>

<p>
This was the first time that I was apprised of the fact
that the custom of Bohemia was likewise prevalent in
Matto Grosso.
</p>

<p>
For an exorbitant price, I bought two cans of salmon
which I washed down with a bottle of warm beer. I had
been counting for the past three days on a square meal
at Diamantino. I returned to the mayor's house and
found that Huber had steadily become worse, and at times
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220'>[220]</a></span>
was so violent that he had to be held down on the bed.
Late that night he took a turn to the better, so the doctor
said, which lasted about seven hours. About five o'clock
in the morning he steadily grew worse and at eight-thirty
died in the presence of the mayor, his family, the doctor,
the priest, one of the guides, and myself. He had only
been sick twenty hours. Although the mayor had said
he had seen cases of sunstroke before, I had never seen
one in the tropics. Moreover as sunstroke is most
frequent in the first hours after sunrise and in those
preceding sundown, it must have been that he was exposed
in the morning of the day before, even before we reached
the pool, for it was then that the hot rays shone on his
head.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i245" id="i245"></a>
<img src="images/i-245.jpg" width="539" height="252" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>House in Diamantino where Huber Died</p>
</div>

<p>
At about eleven o'clock in the morning of the day on
which he died, Huber's lich was interred in the gruesome
cemetery of plain black crosses on the hillside, a mile
beyond the town, I officiating by throwing the last few
shovelfuls of dirt on his eternal resting place. The town
authorities took charge of his possessions and notified
his employers who knew the address of his relations in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221'>[221]</a></span>
Stettin. The mayor would accept no pay, but expressed
the desire that he would like Huber's revolver, belt, and
cartridges. I could not very well refuse seeing that he
and the officials already had possession of all the deceased
man's articles; I would not have refused anyway on
account of the courtesy he showed. I paid the doctor
and the priest, but I also have no doubt that they got
their share for their services from the money that Huber
had in a wallet as well. I stayed that night at the
mayor's house, but the morbidity of the affair depressed
me so much that I left Diamantino early the following
morning for my return trip, being accompanied by Huber's
guide as well as my own to Cuyabá. I saved a day by
traveling the regular track and leaving the source of the
Paraguay River a six hours' ride to the east. I stopped a
day at Cuyabá, another one at Corumbá, and three weeks
later left Asuncion.
</p>

<p>
Four passenger steamers of the Mihanovich line now
ply weekly between Asuncion and Buenos Aires. They
are the <i>Bruselas</i>, the <i>Berna</i>, and the two smaller ships, the
<i>Lambary</i> and the <i>Guarany</i>. The downstream trip takes
over three days. I left Asuncion a Sunday morning on
the <i>Bruselas</i>. The scenery is intensely tropical, but after
the first few miles flat. On the left bank soon after leaving
Asuncion are passed the tumulus of Tucumbú and
the conical-shaped hill, Lambary, the latter a landmark.
Soon on the right we reached the Argentine frontier post
of Pilcomayo, on the long and narrow river of that name.
It rises in the high and bleak plateau of Bolivia and flows
through the Gran Chaco, where for a long space it loses
itself in the marshes only to reappear broader, lower down.
From now on we have Paraguay on the left and the
Argentine territory of Formosa on the right. The only
stops of any importance the first day are Villeta, Formosa,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222'>[222]</a></span>
Villa Oliva, Villa del Pilar, and Humaita. All are Paraguayan,
except Formosa which is the capital of the Argentine
territory of the same name. At Villeta, small boats
laden with cigars, plants, and fruits are rowed out to the
steamers, and the leprous hags to whom these mixed
cargoes belong drive bargains with the sailors, who are
crazy to buy pineapples. Before reaching Villa Oliva,
a palmetto swamp is passed on the Paraguayan side which
stretches backward as far as the eye can see. Villa del
Pilar is the most important Paraguayan town stopped at.
A railroad track on which are flat cars drawn by horses
leads from the town to the dock; these cars are usually
laden with tobacco leaf to be exported to Buenos Aires.
A crowd was at the dock and it much resembled the
crowds seen on the docks of the Great Lakes ports, with
the exception that among its members were sportily
attired youths with high collars, roaring ties, Panama
hats, and patent-leather shoes. It was ludicrous to see
such people in such out-of-the-way places.
</p>

<p>
On the second day out, the broad Paraná River is entered;
the water unlike the blue Paraguay is muddy, and
it is so wide that it is much like an inland sea. Numerous
islands are passed. The shores on the Correntine side
are high and there is no luxuriance of vegetation like in
Paraguay, which republic was left behind when the Paraná
was entered. The aspect is drier and the vast plains
extend back to the eastern horizon. The Chaco and
Santa Fé side is a vast wilderness of cane and brush. The
city of Corrientes, famous for internecine strife, and the
birthplace of Sergeant Cabral, a hero of the War of the
Liberation, was reached in the early hours of the morning
of the second day. The rocks in the quiet water of the
roadstead, overhung with trees above which appeared
church steeples and the domes of the government buildings,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223'>[223]</a></span>
made a fine picture. Soon after leaving Corrientes
the boat anchored at Barranqueras, the port for Resistencia,
capital of the territory of Chaco, and at nightfall
in a pouring rain it anchored again off Puerto Goya, from
which a railroad runs to Goya and to San Diego. On
the third day the boat stopped in the morning at the ancient
capital of Argentina, Paraná, built high on the left
bank of the river, and at night at Rosario. Buenos Aires
was reached on the morning of the fourth day.
</p>

<p>
Another line of steamships plies also between Asuncion
and Buenos Aires, that named the Empresa Domingo
Barthe, but the Mihanovich Line is the best. Domingo
Barthe, the controller of the rival line, is a French adventurer
who made a fortune in Argentina and in Paraguay.
He acquired a large <i>yerba maté</i> concession from the Paraguayan
government which has made him rich. The trademark
of the tea from his <i>yerbales</i> bears the name Asuncion.
Another large firm competed with him, putting out yerba
maté with a different trademark. Barthe then had some
of his tea put up in similar packages to theirs, and stealing
their trademark had it sold widely in Argentina under
their name. The rival company brought suit against
Barthe which went against him. A heavy fine was
imposed upon him with the alternative of a year in jail.
Barthe neither paid the fine nor went to jail. He has
simply kept out of Argentina. Nevertheless Barthe
is a man who has done a lot for Argentina, and the court
may have in view of this fact been too stiff with him;
anyhow that is what the public thinks. Not only has
Barthe been the means of facilitating transportation
between these two countries but he has opened much
of the waste lands of the territory of Misiones and put
them under production, besides being in a large way responsible
for the growth of Posadas, his home town.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224'>[224]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It is pleasant to make the return trip to Buenos Aires
from Asuncion by water after having seen the fields of
Entre Rios and Corrientes from the car window. The
study of faces, the stops at the small towns, the unloading
and loading of cargo make the river trip extremely interesting.
The cargo of the passenger boats is worth inspection
but the odor of the poultry and of the parrot cages is
nauseating. The main deck becomes a storage room for
sacks of yerba maté, the vile tea that the Argentine natives
are crazy about. Much of this on passenger boats
goes to Goya for consumption by the poor <i>chinos</i>, as the
civilized Indians and halfbreeds of the Correntine hinterland
as well as in the rest of the republic are called. The
freight boats handle the Buenos Aires and Rosario supply.
Besides the maté there are numerous pails, tin cans, and
molasses tins filled with plants from Matto Grosso and
the Paraguayan Chaco, mild-eyed deer for the museum
at La Plata, mangy sarias, martinets in cages, a bedlam of
parrots, and bottles of home-made <i>cana</i>, which gives the
imbibers murderous intentions.
</p>

<p>
I sat between two Spaniards at the dining room table.
One had become involved in a domestic scandal, the day
before we left Asuncion, and the wronged husband was
looking for him with a gun, besides having invoked the
aid of the police to find him. The foxy Spaniard, a middle-aged
aristocrat, escaped across the river to Pilcomayo at
night, and as there is no extradition treaty with Argentina,
he was safe. He boarded the <i>Bruselas</i> at that stop.
Both the Spaniards fell to discussing the charms of the
various lady passengers and would occasionally ask me
my opinion. I could not agree with them as they would
pick out some fat type of woman and exclaim: "Que
linda mujer" ("Oh, what a beautiful woman!"). I was
fascinated by the looks of the recently married Brazilian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225'>[225]</a></span>
woman who with her groom sat across the table from us.
She was of that dark type of beauty so common in Matto
Grosso where one meets women of dark complexion, black
gorse-like hair, black flashing eyes, with strong virile
mouths and chins.
</p>

<p>
In South America it is not considered a breach of table
etiquette to be continually picking one's teeth and no
sooner did the meals on the <i>Bruselas</i> begin than the snapping
of wooden toothpicks rent the air. Some of the
guests were ambidextrous as to the use of forks and knives,
the latter especially; they would shovel so much food into
their mouths that they could not contain it all, and consequently
goulash would drop from their mouths onto the
tablecloth. One young barbarian, when passed the menu,
kept it, and instead of passing it on, amused himself by
reading the advertisements on the reverse. He had never
seen one before.

<h2>
CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="s08">SANTIAGO</span>
</h2>

<p>
It is not the intention of the writer in these pages to go
into a detailed and minute historical, geographical, and
statistical description of Chile. This will appear in a
later work. Therefore here will be taken up only those
statistics, political conditions, and geography that the
reader should digest in following me on my trips.
</p>

<p>
The Republic of Chile, whose total length of 2660 miles
is included between latitudes 18° and 56° south, averages
in width but 150 miles which is the territory embraced
between the summits of the Andes on the east and the
Pacific Ocean on the west. It is divided into twenty-four
provinces and one territory. Each of these provinces is
in turn divided into departments. Each of the provinces
has its own governor and each has its own representation
in the national government at Santiago. Of the twenty-four
provinces, fifteen are latitudinal, stretching the whole
width of the country. From north to south these are
Tacna, Tarapacá, Antofagasta, Atacama, Coquimbo,
Choapa, Aconcagua, Santiago, Colchagua, Curico, Talca,
Concepcion, Cautin, Valdivia, and Llanquihue. Four
provinces are maritime, Valparaiso, Maule, Arauco, and
Chiloé; their eastern limits are defined by the summits
of the Coast Range and do not extend to the central valley.
Chiloé is an archipelago. In the littoral provinces the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227'>[227]</a></span>
climate is cooler than in others whose latitude is farther
south owing to the breezes that blow from the Pacific.
Four provinces are Andean, O'Higgins, Linares, Ñuble,
and Bio-Bio. These extend from the Argentine frontier
westward to the central valley
but in no part do they ever
reach the coast. There is only
one interior province, Malleco;
it is absolutely surrounded by
other provinces, and neither extends
to the ocean on the west
nor to the mountain peaks on
the east.</p>

<p class='caption'>Diagram Showing Idea
of Central Valley of Chile
in Relationship to the Andes
Mountains and the
Coast Range, with Course
of Streams</p>
</div>

<p>
From Santiago southward 350
miles to the Bio-Bio River there
is what is known as the central
valley; here in the cities,
villages, and country between
the Andes and the Coast Range
live two thirds of the entire
population of the republic. Although
this central valley is
but one long valley and traversing
it longitudinally from
Santiago to the Bio-Bio there
is no marked difference in elevation,
yet it is not the valley of one single river,
nor do any rivers run through it lengthwise
as do the San Joaquin and the Sacramento in California.
This valley is formed by the valleys of
countless small rivers which cross it and widening out
midway between their sources and their mouths form
one large valley which has an average width of about
sixty miles. The geological theory is that in the pre-glacial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228'>[228]</a></span>
period the small rivers like to-day rushed headlong
from the Andes into the ocean. The Coast Range
sprang up, but the rivers worked faster than the mountains
grew, so that their courses were not altered, and
the Coast Range instead of being one continuous range
of mountains, even though it is a mountain chain, became
bunches of land islets, separated from one another by
streams.
</p>

<p>
Of the thirteen largest cities of Chile, only four are
found in this valley, Santiago, the metropolis, Talca,
the sixth city in population, Chillán, the seventh, and
Curico, the twelfth. This signifies nothing for although
less than one third of the large towns are situated here,
yet the valley teems with towns that have between 1500
and 4000 inhabitants. The central valley is of remarkable
fertility, but although the soil is highly productive,
irrigation is resorted to for it seldom rains during the
summer months. In the winter there is plenty of rainfall.
Owing to the great number of streams, most of
which, however, are unnavigable and all of which rise in
the Andes, there is plenty of water for irrigation. In
their course to the ocean they bring much silt which gives
them a muddy color. In contrast to them are the clear
streams of transparent water which feed them. The
latter are mostly from springs in the foothills, and not
having to cut their way for any great distance carry no
silt. The products of the central valley are wine, fruits,
cereals, and stock. A Californian whom I met in Santiago
said to me: "This central valley of Chile reminds me of
California, but it is more productive, and in a much more
advanced state of cultivation."
</p>

<p>
Southern Chile, as that part of the republic south of the
Bio-Bio is termed, is a rolling and mountainous land,
originally forested and still so in some sections. The altitude
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229'>[229]</a></span>
of perpetual snow is lower here than farther north,
and some of the mountain scenery excels that of Switzerland.
It has an abundance of rainfall not restricted to
seasons so irrigation is unnecessary. The country is
largely devoted to the growing of cereals, especially barley,
and to dairy farming. The climate, never too warm in
summer, is in winter that of the Central States of the
Union. No tropical fruits and plants grow there, but
many apples are grown. The farmers are mostly Germans
who have lived there for three generations and have still
retained the customs of the fatherland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230'>[230]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Of northern Chile, nothing much needs to be said.
From La Serena northward it is one large sterile tract of
land, with the exception of a few river valleys where
there is verdure and vegetation, such as at Tacna, Copiapó,
and Vallenar. It is one large desert and ranges of barren
mountains rising to a great height, and on whose lower
slopes on plateaus is found most of the world's nitrate of
sodium supply. In the higher altitudes are borax fields
and great mineral deposits of copper, silver, and gold.
The coast is absolutely rainless and water is unobtainable
by wells. It seldom rains even in the interior. The
small rivers formed by the melting of the snow on high
mountain peaks lose themselves in the sands and seldom
reach the ocean. Near their upper reaches water is piped
from them to the coast towns, which are at a great distance.
It is thus that Iquique, Tocopilla, and the thriving
port of Antofagasta get their water supply.</p>

</div>

<p>
The area of Chile is 289,829 square miles, about the size
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231'>[231]</a></span>
of the States of Texas and Arkansas combined, but the
opposite to them in geographical contour. The population
December 31, 1915, was 3,641,477 or 12.57 inhabitants
to the square mile.
</p>

<p>
Each locality in Chile is famous for some special natural
production or manufacture. Bywords denote the superiority
of one article over others of a like species such as:
Black pottery from Chillán, reed baskets from Linares,
beer from Valdivia, marble from Valparaiso, cider and
butter from Osorno, figs from Huasco, and frutillas from
Puerto Varas. (Frutilla is the name given to a diminutive
and highly flavored strawberry that grows both wild and
in the domestic state.)
</p>

<p>
Chile has a system of longitudinal railways, nearly
completed, which are of the greatest military value.
Nearly two thousand miles from Puerto Montt in the south
to Tacna in the north, with the exception of a short stretch
between Pisagua and Arica, are open to traffic, and at no
place do they touch the sea excepting at Coquimbo and
their terminals. In quick time troops and ammunition
can be moved to any part of the republic. There are
many spurs and branch lines that run to the coast, to the
mining centers, and to the numerous inland towns. Most
of the railroads are broad gauge; some are both broad and
narrow; others are narrow, while in the central valley
there are a few light railways, for example the one between
Linares and Panimávida, and the coöperative railway in
the Province of Ñuble. There is a heavy traffic both
in freight and in passengers, but sad to relate, most
of the railways owned by the government, which constitute
the majority, are run at a loss. This is caused in
a great measure by the large personnel employed, most
of whom are the henchmen of the politicians in power in
Santiago. To overcome the monetary loss, one half of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232'>[232]</a></span>
the regular number of trains have been taken off from
the service schedule so that at the time of this writing one
cannot enjoy a ride from Santiago to Concepcion on an
express train or in a Pullman car as previously. The only
express trains are those that run between Santiago and
Valparaiso and vice versa. Even though but one half of
the trains are still in operation, the State lines are still
showing a deficit, and there is talk of leasing them to
private corporations. The cars are mostly of American
manufacture although some of the sleeping cars are
English. The locomotives, formerly German, are now for
the most part manufactured in Valparaiso. The narrow
gauge lines in the north, which are in the nitrate
regions, all pay for they are of private ownership and
there is no chance of giving unnecessary employment.
The Transandine Railroad, narrow gauge, which formerly
had trains running thrice a week from Los Andes to
Mendoza, Argentina, now has through trains only once a
week, and the trip is made in the daytime on account of
dangerous curves.</p>

</div>

<p>
There is but little manufacturing in Chile, most of it
being centralized in Valparaiso. The great drawback is
on account of the lack of iron; some of this mineral has
been discovered in the Province of Coquimbo, and I understand
that the property known as La Higuera is on a
paying basis. There is plenty of coal, the mines at Lota
being the largest, but it is of an inferior quality. Outside
of Valparaiso, the only manufactures of importance are
those of beer and flour. In this respect the manufacturing
conditions are similar to those of Argentina. Nearly
every small town in the grain belt, the country lying
south of the Bio-Bio, has its flour mills; as the brewing
business is in the hands of a trust, there is but a small
opportunity in this field unless one starts with considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233'>[233]</a></span>
capital. The beer trust, capitalized at 18,000,000
pesos ($3,070,800) paid in, includes all the large
breweries in Chile excepting two firms, that of Aubel in
Osorno which is flourishing as an independent brewery
and that of Keller which has two breweries, one in
Concepcion and the other in Talca. Those belonging
to the trust are the United Breweries Company in Limache-Cousiño,
the Valdivia Breweries Company in Valdivia,
the Andres Ebner Brewery in Santiago, the Calera
Brewery in Calera, and the Floto Brewery in La Serena,
the last named being a small one. Scattered through
Chile are a good number of independent breweries all run
on a small scale and catering only to local trade such as
Horstmann's Brewery in Santiago, a brewery in San
Felipe, one in Chillán, one in La Union, one in Puerto
Montt, and two in Punta Arenas. Since the Anwandter
firm in Valdivia sold out to the trust their successors brew
a much better beer than previously was brewed there, but
I am sorry to say that the product of one of the trust
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234'>[234]</a></span>
breweries, that of Calera, is vileness incarnate. Beer is
cheap in Chile, three cents buying a schuper, but it likewise
is apt to go to the head and make the imbiber see
double lamp-posts. The German residents claim that it is
mild, yet I have seen many of them unable to pace a crack
in the floor after imbibing a few libations of it. The
saloons in Santiago do a big business but they have to
pay a high rent which cuts into their profits.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the inhabitants, the Chileno is called the
Yankee of South America. He is not afraid of work,
consequently steamship companies like to employ him,
because for less pay he will do more work than any person
of any nationality will do, including North Americans.
He is the only native south of Texas who if hit will come
back at his aggressor. In behavior he is apt to be rough
and coarse (this does not apply to the aristocracy), but
rarely is he uncivil. Many Chilenos ape the tonsorial
adornment of a man who died in the year 33<span class='smcap'> A.D.</span>, but I
do not believe their actions jibe with his if what we read
in history is true. The women are beautiful; they have
no comparison anywhere else in the whole world. They
have dark complexions, are finely featured, and are voluptuous.
A poor figure is unknown among them. If a
man prefers a different type than the average he can go to
southern Chile and have the choice of a dark red-cheeked
Araucanian maiden or a native girl of German extraction,
whose eyes are like the still deep water of a pool, and whose
cheeks have that rosy tinge of a ripening apple. In the
railway eating-house in Rancagua, I met a man from
Thomasville, Georgia, who said that on account of the
looks of the Chilean women, he would lose his religion if
he remained much longer in the country. I do not know
what his religion was, but their beauty is enough to affect a
man's head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235'>[235]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
One of the Chilean institutions that bears comment is
that of the table waiters in the hotels and restaurants. It
needs serious improvement. The waiters are a white-aproned,
moustached, whiskered set who go after and
bring back food on the run. They never walk and vie with
one another to make the most noise and bring their feet
down heaviest after taking orders. The waiter takes
your order on the run, slams the food in front of you on
the run, takes your money on the run, accepts his tip and
thanks you on the run. In Europe and in the United
States, these actions would not be tolerated in a first-class
café. In Chile, however, these are the instructions
given to the waiters when they seek employment.
</p>

<p>
In the larger towns, especially in Santiago and in
Valparaiso, there is a great illegitimacy of births among
the lower classes. This is due to the inconstant actions of
the men. For instance a poor laborer will marry a girl
and live with her several years, during which time she will
become the mother of several children. The husband in
the meantime finding that the support of a family leaves
him with no pocket money to indulge in his periodical
debauches, all of a sudden, without saying anything to his
wife, deserts her and strikes out for the country where he
obtains employment. He rarely comes back. The poor
wife, left destitute with several offspring, has a hard time
making a living. Other young women, cognizant of the
fickle actions of the men, prefer living with them outside
of wedlock, for if the man deserts her a woman still has a
chance of getting married, while if she was once married, it
would be impossible for her to marry again, because there
is no divorce law in Chile. I have known of people in Chile
who desired a divorce being obliged to go to Uruguay to
live as I understand that is the only republic in South
America where divorces are granted. As to morals I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236'>[236]</a></span>
imagine Chile is no worse off than any other country,
excepting among the lower element. Speaking of them
to a friend of mine, one of the most prominent men in
Valparaiso and a high official of the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company, he said: "Among the lower class there is
but little distinction between the women who are virtuous
and those who are not. The former are always on the <i>qui
vive</i> to increase their income providing they do not get
caught at it."
</p>

<p>
Among this stratum the Fiesta of the Angelito (Feast
of the Little Angel) plays an important rôle. They
maintain that if a child dies it becomes a little angel, and
many of the poor to whom the expense of rearing a superfluous
child is a burden welcome its decease although they
do much wailing at the funeral. They welcome it for
they have a chance to make some money and also indulge
in an alcoholic debauch. When the child dies the parents
invite all their friends to their home. Great quantities
of cheap wine are ordered and consumed. Each friend
gives as much money as he can afford toward the burial
expenses and towards the purchase of the liquid refreshments.
A drunken orgy lasting all night takes place.
After it is over and the body is buried, the parents have
money left over. Owing to the high mortality among
infants, on account of neglect, malnutrition, and ever present
typhoid fever, these Fiestas of the Angelito are of
frequent occurrence in every neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
Chile is the only country in South America which has
strict prohibition laws. There are quite a few localities
that are "dry." Saloons are closed all day Sundays;
bars also close early at night. The penalties for breaking
these laws are heavy, yet in no other country in South
America, with the exception of Peru, is there as much
drunkenness as in Chile, and all these other countries
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237'>[237]</a></span>
have no prohibition laws, and their towns are wide
open.

The reception given at Santiago to the occupants of
the private train from Buenos Aires bearing the special
ambassadors and their staff to the installation of Chile's
president was tremendous. As the train rolled into the
great and high vaulted Mapocho station amid the fanfare
and beating of drums, martial music broke out and
rent the air with the national march. Great sturdy,
powerfully built blonde officers, helmeted, in their full
dress uniforms, exact replicas of the German army of a
decade ago, grouped themselves on the platform to greet
the guests. Their subordinates stood at attention until
the last of the officers who had boarded the train at Los
Andes left the train. In the background stood symmetrical
rows of policemen parting a human aisle down
which we passed to the vigorous blasts of a band. Thousands
of people cried "Hurrah" which was echoed and
reëchoed through the lofty waiting room of the great
building. At the windows and on the street behind the
iron grating of the train shed were squeezed myriads of
faces endeavoring to catch a view of the impressive spectacle.
At the curb outside the station doors, to where the
guests had already advanced, stood dignified statesmen in
Prince Alberts awaiting the arrival of the automobiles
from the Ministries of Brazil and of Argentina which were
to drive the envoys of those two respective countries away.
Soon several limousines arrived, their chauffeurs decorated
with large rosettes of green and yellow, and blue and white,
the symbolical colors of those two large South American
republics. There was no car whose driver was adorned
with red, the color of Portugal, for that last-named
country has no minister to Chile solely (their representative
to Buenos Aires looks after the affairs of Portuguese
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238'>[238]</a></span>
in Chile), so little Botelho was obliged to take a non-decorated
automobile which drove him and de Lima to the
Hotel Oddo, to which place Mr. Alexander and myself
also went.
</p>

<p>
The military pageant which continued throughout the
ensuing week was most impressive. The Chilean army,
trained by German officers, and their navy by British
officers, are always prepared and on the alert for any infringements
on their national rights. Chile is the strongest
fighting power in South America, and has the best military
organization. Its men are born fighters who have the
advantage of superior training. The whole personnel and
equipment of their army can undoubtedly put in the background
any country in the world which has a population
double that of Chile. The Brazilian and Argentine officers
and soldiers taken as a whole show up mighty poorly
compared to those of Chile. Here we have a reproduction
of the German army on a small scale. The uniforms
are similar to those that Germany had before the latter
country adapted the gray color. It is interesting to note
that von der Goltz, who reorganized the Turkish army
at the time of the Balkan War, had been once loaned by
Germany to Chile to bring its army to a state of efficiency.</p>

<p class='caption-sub'>
This is a veritable land mountain. It rises abruptly about 200 feet from the floor of the Mapocho Valley, the latter being as flat as a table top.
Its area in size of a few city blocks has been transformed into a park. From the summit the vista is superb.</p>
</div>

<p>
The city of Santiago is compactly and massively built
within the small area which constitutes that part of terrain
included within the city limits. The streets are invariably
straight, forming square and rectangular blocks of
houses whose average height of two stories forms an even
sky line. Although there are several different styles of
architecture prevailing in the residences, the old Spanish
type predominating, yet there is a great and unmistakable
similarity as to the appearance of the streets. The business
section is a direct contradiction to the residential
part in so far that it is modern and is becoming more so.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239'>[239]</a></span>
Here the buildings are three and four stories in height and
a look down either of the streets that are named Ahumada
and Estado leaves an impression of Vienna although it is
a concrete instead of a stone one. In several other parts
of the city this similarity is present for the long fronts of
divers beneficial societies and the towers of churches and
convents present a scene very much like that of the Austrian
capital.
</p>

<p>
The population of Santiago is slightly over four hundred
thousand. The growth of the city as well as of the other
towns of the central valley is imperceptible. It has been
this way for ages. There is little immigration to Chile,
and that which does come in, goes either to the northern
or southern provinces of the republic where labor conditions
are better. With the exception of the business
section, Santiago is an extremely reserved, conservative,
and quiet old place. It can also be called serious. After
nine o'clock at night, even on the Ahumada, all is quiet,
a pleasant contrast to the din and racket of Buenos Aires,
which murders the darkness, making sleep impossible.
There is but little gayety about the Chilean metropolis;
the aristocracy of the city, which can boast of the purest
white blood of any American capital, form a society into
which a foreigner, no matter how prominent his antecedents
are, is seldom admitted. This dignified aristocracy
constitute the brains of the country and control the
politics. Prominent in the affairs of state, finance, and
daily doings are the names Vergara, Edwards, Sanfuentes,
Subercaseaux, Sotomayor, Balmaceda, Montt, Tocornal,
and Luco. Their mansions, the pride of Chile, are not
located on show places like the Alameda or in what we
would call the fashionable suburbs, but are situated on
those downtown streets which fringe the business section.
Their stateliness seems to exhale an air of their own.

The Avenida de las Delicias, called the Alameda, runs
east and west, and divides Santiago into two nearly
equal parts. The quarter of the city lying north of it is
the mercantile part, while that south of it is the residential
district. This broad avenue, which inside the city limits
is two miles long, is in some places at least one hundred
yards wide. Its center is a broad unpaved parkway,
bordered by ancient trees; its hard dirt walks constitute
the rambla of the inhabitants evenings. At short intervals
are statues, some of them being very fine. Vendors of
cigars, cakes, soft drinks, and magazines have established
booths here, and it is a very common sight to see men
freezing ice cream under the trees. The benches are of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243'>[243]</a></span>
concrete and are plastered over; when a person with a dark
suit sits on one of them he generally departs with a white
daub on the seat of his trousers. Along both sides of the
parkway are wide carriage roads, the paving of which is
full of holes and ruts, making driving uncomfortable. On
the whole the Alameda falls short of what can be called
beautiful for although it is flanked by some very handsome
residences yet between them are sandwiched many second-class
shops. This avenue is essential for Santiago for
it affords a breathing space for the overpopulated city as
the parks are quite a distance from downtown and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245'>[245]</a></span>
Plaza de Armas is nearly always crowded during the heat
of the day. At the western city limits where the name of
the Alameda changes from that of Avenida de las Delicias
to Avenida Latorre is the large glass-roofed train shed and
station of Alameda, the principal one of Santiago, whence
all passengers for southern Chile depart. Near the eastern
city limits the Alameda becomes the Avenida de la
Providencia. It here reaches the muddy Mapocho River,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246'>[246]</a></span>
whose southern bank it skirts, and continuing into the
country enters the defile of its headwaters.</p>

One of the most curious freaks to be found anywhere is
the Cerro de Santa Lucia which rises abruptly about two
hundred feet from the very center of the plain on which
Santiago stands, and is well within the city limits. This
hill has been created into a beautiful park with every
imaginable species of native tree, and has within its confines
grottoes, groups of rocks, lookout towers, and statues,
those of Caupolican and of Valdivia being the best. No
stranger to Santiago should fail to walk to its summit,
especially at evening when the sun casts its rays on the
high Andes in the background. There is a small admission
fee to be paid on entering the park at the Cerro de Santa
Lucia, but it is well worth it. On the hill is a restaurant
café which is popular with the public on summer nights,
for on its terrace one can take meals out-of-doors.

<p>
I was specially fortunate in being able to see the ceremonies
pertaining to the installation of the new President,
Señor Don Juan Luis Sanfuentes, having obtained an
excellent seat through the kindness of the American
Ambassador, Honorable Henry Prather Fletcher. I acquired
a reserved seat in the Capitol in close proximity
to the whole proceedings. There is no inauguration like
in Washington. In a lofty rectangular hall of the Capitol,
called the Camara de Diputados, there are arranged,
on both sides of a carpeted open space, seats in order,
which during the sessions of Congress are occupied by
deputies. These seats on December 23, 1915, were occupied
by their proper holders. In seats of honor near
the west end of the hall sat the ambassadors, ministers,
and attachés of the foreign powers. At the extreme west
end was a platform with several arm-chairs. On all four
sides of this high room rose balconies, those on the north
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247'>[247]</a></span>
and south having two tiers while those on the east and
west had one tier. They were packed to overcrowding with
the invited guests of the deputies and statesmen, many
of the occupants of the seats being ladies. At two o'clock
sharp there was a sudden hush to the conversations of those
present. The ranks at the north door stood aside, and
through their opening tottered the aged Ramon Barros
Luco in dress suit, the red, white, and blue tricolor of Chile
fastened obliquely on his white stiff bosomed shirt. The
applause was great. Following quickly in his footsteps
came several members of his cabinet; all crossed the carpeted
room and seated themselves on the platform.</p>

<p>
The applause started again and amidst yells, cheers,
and the stamping of hundreds of feet there came through
the again opened ranks of the crowd at the north door a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249'>[249]</a></span>
large, stout, red-faced man past middle age with gray hair
and moustache of the same color, Don Juan Luis Sanfuentes,
followed by his new cabinet, a mitered archbishop in
robes of purple and red, and several purple-robed bishops.
Sanfuentes took his seat on the platform to the right of
Luco. Two short speeches were made by statesmen;
Luco then rose and taking off his tricolor handed it to
Sanfuentes who pinned it on himself and changed seats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250'>[250]</a></span>
with the former President. Thus at this transmission of
command which takes the place of our presidential
inauguration, Sanfuentes became President of Chile; his
term does not expire until December 23, 1920. The
whole ceremony lasted less than twenty minutes.</p>

From the Capitol the procession went to the cathedral
where the archbishop held mass and delivered his blessing,
for Chile is still allied to the Roman Catholic Church.
There was a great street parade after this ceremony. I
viewed it from a balcony on the Ahumada down which
street it marched. It was really very good. Helmeted
German officers galloped back and forth giving orders,
while a cordon of blue-jacketed, white-trousered policemen
held the sidewalk mob back by means of ropes
strung lengthwise the whole block. No procession ever
lacks something of the ridiculous. It was in evidence
this day. Scarcely had the presidential victoria passed
when a limousine automobile containing high officials
appeared. To its running board clung a large, middle-aged,
drunken monk, his black and white garments tied
together by a cord, flowing in the breeze. This hideous
spectacle had reached a spot underneath the balcony
where I was standing, when a dignified man wearing a silk
hat stepped from the crowd and grabbed the inebriated
fool, dragging him from the running board. A good-sized
crowd hissed the monk as with staggering steps he betook
himself to the sidelines.</p>

was the finest that I had ever witnessed. Picture to

light of polished weapons. Picture in the foreground a
small grandstand of lumber draped with the red, white,
and blue Chilean flags; imagine this grandstand filled with
beautiful ladies in gowns of the latest creations, whiskered
gentlemen in silk hats, and army officers in full dress uniform.
Behind this scene imagine a forest of pine and
eucalyptus above whose dark green crests tower high
brown, barren, snow-capped mountains. This is the
scene that unfolded itself to the spectator of that memorable
military review.</p>

Long before the President drove up in his victoria,
the buzzing of airships caused one to look up and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253'>[253]</a></span>
there at a height of two thousand feet five of these
mechanical birds were disporting themselves. All hats
came off, and there was a great clapping of hands when
Sanfuentes arrived. He drove twice around the parade
ground and finally stopped in front of the grandstand.
First came in review before him four companies of the
military school in uniform of light blue coats with white
trousers and white horsehair high hats; next came innumerable
infantry companies each preceded by a brass
band which stood to one side as the columns marched by.
The infantry was followed by the artillery which came
by at a gallop, smothering the field in a cloud of dust.
This and the cavalry which followed seemed to be the most
admired by the spectators, judging from the cheers which
greeted them.

<p>
I wish to state that in the choice of Honorable Henry
Prather Fletcher, who at the time of this writing is United
States Ambassador to Mexico, he having left Chile in
1916, our government should be credited with having made
such an admirable selection. He is as fine a representative
of man as exists in the diplomatic service of any country.
When I was in Chile in 1912, a certain gossiping old woman,
the daughter of one of Chile's former presidents, knocked
him to me, and I being a stranger was fool enough to
believe her. At my first meeting with Mr. Fletcher in
December, 1915, I at once saw what caliber of man he is,
and have felt like kicking myself ever since for believing
Doña Anna Swinburne de Jordan. I came to Santiago in
1915 absolutely unknown to Mr. Fletcher, and he showed
me great kindness in procuring for me admission to the
different ceremonies pertinent to the installation of the new
President besides entertaining me at his own residence.
</p>

<p>
I met two of his secretaries to the embassy, a Mr.
Martin, who seemed to be a fine clean-cut young man, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254'>[254]</a></span>
fellow named Johnston or Johnson, I being mixed in his
surname because I never took the trouble to recall it.
This Johnston was the worst snob that I ever recollect
to have met. While I was at the embassy in the presence
of Mr. Fletcher he was extremely cordial and agreeable,
and even invited me to dine with him at his club to which
he was going to procure me a card. The next day Mr.
Henry Alexander of Philadelphia and I were walking
along Bandera Street near the Capitol when we happened
accidentally to meet Johnston who was approaching us
from the direction we were walking in. He was dressed in
a Prince Albert and a high silk hat crowned his tall, slim
figure. We greeted him but he returned our salutations
with the curtest imitation of a nod possible. I met him
a dozen times afterwards by accident, sometimes on the
street and sometimes at the Grand Hotel where he generally
dined at noon. All these times he cut me dead as if
he had never seen me before. Later I had the next seat
to him on the Pullman car on a train but he did not deign
to recognize my presence, even though he had been most
affable in his treatment of me while I was a guest of Mr.
Fletcher.
</p>

<p>
Santiago, although it is a pleasant and agreeable place
with a most benign climate, I am sorry to say is none too
clean nor are its streets well kept up. In the Alameda
there are big holes in the asphalt, and the cobblestones
on the side streets are uneven and out of place. Many of
the streets are not paved. There are holes in some of the
sidewalks where a pedestrian is apt to sprain his ankle,
and there is much refuse dirt and filth accumulated along
the curbs. There are no alleys in the city so the inhabitants
deposit the swill in iron pails. The garbage man
comes along with his wagon every morning and stopping
in front of every house rings a bell to let the inmates know
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255'>[255]</a></span>
of his presence so that they can bring out the pails. On
the poorer lighted side streets inhabitants perform the calls
of Nature on the sidewalks, in the middle of the road,
and against the sides of the buildings, which besides being
unsanitary causes hideous stenches. There is always a good
complement of typhoid fever in the Chilean and Peruvian
towns so while on my visit at the time of the presidential
installation I warned my servant, O'Brien, to drink mineral
water instead of that of the city supply. The latter
evidently interpreted other drinks in the clause for when
I came to settle my bill at the Hotel Oddo, I found that
he had run up a considerable wine bill which necessitated
me to dispense with his services.
</p>

<p>
The stature of the Santiaguinos is much greater than that
of the inhabitants of Buenos Aires. It is in every respect
equal to the North American standard. The <i>profanum
vulgus</i> are apt to be rough, showing their independence.
One observes quite a few red-haired natives, which denotes
that in the course of genealogy one or more of their
maternal ancestors have been chased by Irishmen. The
women outnumber the men and are well formed and
comely, many being beautiful. I prefer the looks of the
Chilenas to those of any other women in South America.
In 1912 in Santiago there were but few Germans and the
number of foreigners was exceedingly small. In 1916
the city was teeming with Germans and they outnumbered
all the other foreigners put together. In Valparaiso
in 1915 the English and German residents of that port
had a street fight. The tram company was a German
syndicate and the natives, angered by the car fare rates,
which they thought were excessive, sided with the English
and rose against the Teutonic element. A riot followed
in which some windows were broken and there was a
certain local sentiment against the Germans which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256'>[256]</a></span>
became so strong that it caused an exodus of a great many
of them to Santiago. Also many of the crews of the
interned German merchantmen left their ships and came
to Santiago and other towns of the interior where they
have established themselves in business, many of them
having become proprietors of hotels, restaurants, and beer
saloons. They have prospered and have taken out citizenship
papers, preferring to remain in Chile than in their
own country.</p>

<p>
There was a German immigration to Chile in 1848, and
another one in 1866. Both of these exoduses were due
to the oppression of the military system in the old country
and it is safe to surmise that there will be another such
exodus to Chile at the end of the present war. I have read
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257'>[257]</a></span>
statements that one quarter of Chile's population is either
German or of direct German extraction. This seems to be
an exaggeration, although I believe that one fourth of the
population has some German blood.
</p>

<p>
The Grand Hotel, which is on Calle Huerfanos, not far
from the main business section is the only first-class hotel
in Santiago. It is owned by Emil Kehle, an American.
He and his sister have the Hotel Royal in Valparaiso
which is the best hotel in that port. This Grand Hotel
which is comfortable has good rooms, and board and is
homelike in atmosphere. I liked it so well that in the
spring of 1916, I stopped there two months. The Willard
party, which was the family of our ambassador to Spain,
and Kermit Roosevelt, arrived in Santiago while I was
there and likewise stopped at Mr. Kehle's hostelry.
</p>

<p>
On my trip to Santiago in 1915, I was not aware that
Mr. Kehle had a hotel in that city, so I went to the Oddo
where I had previously stayed on a former visit. The
rooms in the Oddo were good but I am sorry to say that
the cuisine and dining room service was execrable. Unkempt
and unshaven waiters dropped food from the platters
onto the floor, and clumsily running to serve a guest
would slip in the spilled soup and drop plates of unsavory
and indescribable edibles to the din of broken dishes.
For seventy years this hotel had been in existence, the
last twenty-five of them under the proprietorship of the
French family of Girard. The bung-eyed but accommodating
daughter told me that on January 3, 1916, this hotel
would close its doors for good. "We are returning to
France to live as we have worked long enough," she said.
Yet, however, when I came back to Santiago in March,
1916, they hadn't returned to France and the Oddo was
still running, though minus its dining room. The other
hotels are the Milan, well spoken of, and the Melossi near
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258'>[258]</a></span>
the Alameda Station, poorly located as it is too far from
the center of activity.
</p>

<p>
The restaurants are fair, that named the Club Santiago
being good. The Restaurant Niza is fair. It is owned
by a Spaniard who, if the guest does not understand the
local name of the meat on the menu, will demonstrate on
his own fat physiology that part from which the succulent
morsel is taken. There is a good restaurant in the Palacio
Urmaneta. It must be taken under consideration that
ladies do not frequent these places unaccompanied for no
other reason solely than that it is the custom of the country.
They generally take their meals in the hotel dining
rooms.
</p>

<p>
I met a North American university professor in Santiago
who was always kicking because he did not know
enough Spanish to order what he wanted to eat. He
was stopping at the Oddo and the food there was so vile
that he could not digest it. He was wishing that there
was an American hotel in the city and this being in 1915,
and I not knowing that Mr. Kehle had the Grand Hotel,
knew of no place where I could recommend him to go.
One morning, however, he burst into my room and
proffering me a card told me to read it.
</p>

<p>
"See what I've got," he cried in glee; "a nice-looking
woman handed it to me on the street."
</p>

<p>
I took the piece of pasteboard that he so eagerly extended
to me. It was about an inch long and half as
wide. The printed inscription on it read: "Pension Norte
Americana" giving street name and number. I turned
to the professor and said: "It reads, North American
boarding-house with the number of the street."
</p>

<p>
"Just what I thought," he said. "It's the very thing
I want. I certainly would like to be among my fellow
countrymen again, and now that the Oddo is closing its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259'>[259]</a></span>
doors, I shall go there at once and inquire about the
terms." He did, and immediately upon admittance was
pounced upon by four ladies of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
This is an example of one of the means by which brothels
are touted in Santiago.
</p>

<p>
The Chilean capital is a rat warren; rodents abound
everywhere. Most of the buildings being adobe, these
animals have bored holes all through the walls and have
perforated the foundations. I do not believe that New
Orleans in its rattiest days ever had anywhere near such a
large population of the family Muridæ as Santiago at the
present time possesses. Lying in bed nights one is kept
awake by the patter of their little feet as they run across
the corrugated iron roofs mingled with their sharp squeals.
Oftentimes looking out of the window at night, their long
tails can be seen silhouetted in the moonlight hanging over
the window-tops.
</p>

<p>
The death rate of Santiago is high, excessively so in
infantile diseases which cause the largest mortality toll.
The rate for all Chile is 29.4 per thousand inhabitants,
while that of Santiago alone is 36.7. Only one South
American city of which any record is kept surpasses it in
this negligible respect, that being Lima, Peru, with a death
rate of 51 per thousand inhabitants. Even Guayaquil,
notorious for yellow fever and bubonic plague, has a better
record than these two last-mentioned cities, which have no
yellow fever, and Santiago minus bubonic plague. Typhoid
fever is always prevalent in the Chilean capital, but
I doubt if it is as malignant as in North America, on
account of its being so common. This large death rate is
mostly among the lower classes who are ignorant and have
no knowledge of sanitation. Longevity is more common
than in any other South American capital with the possible
exception of Rio de Janeiro which is testimony that if
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260'>[260]</a></span>
a person survives childhood, a healthy old age is allotted
him.
</p>

<p>
The cemetery named the Cementerio Jeneral is the largest
in Christendom, not in area but in the number of bodies
interred. It is exceeded in size by only one other
cemetery in the world, that one being the Mohammedan
cemetery in Scutari in Asia across the Bosporus from
Constantinople. In fineness of its monuments it is only
surpassed by the Campo Santo in Genoa and the Recoleta
in Buenos Aires. The nature of the Santiago cemetery
is entirely different from these last-mentioned two. It is
not a rivalry between the grave lot owners who shall have
the most expensive allegorical marble sculpture as in
Genoa, but is a vast conglomeration of brick tombs,
some of them being veritable mausoleums. Here are
buried the most famous families of Chile. The Chilenos
make a great deal of ceremony about their dead. A poor
family will stint itself for years to accumulate enough
lucre to erect a proper sepulchre. It will spend $10,000
to build a monument, while for $1000 it could place in their
dwelling a modern sanitary system, which when installed
would do away with the cause that would lead the person
to be buried beneath the monument. This cemetery is
divided by straight walks into square blocks; at the intersection
of each of these walks is a cross or a fountain.
Cedars, pines, eucalyptus, cypresses, boxwood, and other
funereal trees abound; there are also beds of brilliant
flowers. The tomb of ex-president Don Pedro Montt who
died in Bremen, August, 1910, is here; it is a tall monolith
with a glazed green and brown tile frieze. There is a
morgue near the left entrance to the cemetery and the
stench of the ripe corpses is decidedly odoriferous.
</p>

<p>
About ten miles northeast of Santiago on the slopes of
the Andes are the springs of Apoquindo, visited much by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261'>[261]</a></span>
the inhabitants of the capital Sunday afternoons. The
trip is worth while making once, but that is sufficient, for
the poor condition of the country roads together with
the dust take away much of the pleasure of the drive.
The best road leads through the city of Providencia, which
adjoins Santiago on the east and which is so much like a
continuation of the capital that it is impossible to tell
without looking at a map where the boundary line between
the two cities is. At the Avenida Pedro de Valdivia, a
broad boulevard on which are magnificent villas and the
summer homes of the wealthy Santiaguinos one turns
to the right and keeps straight ahead until the main street
of Nuñoa is reached. Nuñoa is a town of nine thousand
inhabitants, a mixture of wealth and poverty with well
shaded streets, poor shops, and adobe buildings.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i286" id="i286"></a>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262'>[262]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A few miles beyond Nuñoa is a roadhouse named the
Quinta Roma, which was formerly the mansion of an
estanciero but is now the terminus for joy-riders, many of
whom are to be met with returning to the capital late
afternoons in a highly hilarious condition. To the credit
of the Chileno joy-rider, he does not hit up the great speed
of his North American brethren; thus there are but few
automobile accidents. The roadhouse stands in a garden
of flowers well back from the thoroughfare in a nicely kept
lawn. Here is a liquid refreshment dispensary where I
have seen gay youths hoist comely maidens upon the bar,
and seated there clink glasses with their standing male
affinities whose arms encircle their waists to the tune of
popping corks and the metallic ring of beer caps as the
latter fall to the floor. In the garden behind the bar is a
bamboo thicket planted in the form of room partitions.
It is so dense that no peeker can look through its foliage
to observe the love affairs being enacted in these natural
chambers which correspond to the European "separées"
or the so-called "private dining rooms" of the North
American roadhouses.
</p>

<p>
At Apoquindo there are several soda springs with baths
and a swimming pool all of which are kept in a filthy
condition. Like at Cacheuta and at Cauquenes but few
people come to take the baths and none to drink the
water. Most everybody congregates at the bar in the
hotel across the street&mdash;the baths are but the name of an
excuse.

<h2>
CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="s08">BATHS OF CAUQUENES. CHILOÉ ISLAND. LAKE NAHUEL
HUAPI</span>
</h2>

<p>
In Lady Anne Brassey's nonpareil book, <i>Around the
World in the Yacht Sunbeam</i>, published by Henry Holt and
Company, New York, 1882, she describes on pages 159-161
her visit to the Baths of Cauquenes where she sojourned
two days, October 23-25, 1876. When I was in
Chile in 1913, I never heard of these baths and returned
home ignorant of their existence. In the interim I
thoroughly read Lady Brassey's book and determined
that if the opportunity ever presented itself that I would
likewise visit them. Darwin visited them in 1836.
While in Santiago in 1915, on looking at a map, I found
that there was a city named Cauquenes in the Province of
Maule in south-central Chile, it being the provincial capital.
I had made up my mind to go to that place, when
the bung-eyed girl who managed the Hotel Oddo showed
me my error and informed me that the Cauquenes I was
seeking, was not a great distance from Santiago and was
reached by train from Rancagua.
</p>

<p>
One morning I left the Alameda Station at 9.30 and
two hours later arrived at Rancagua. The ride was
through a fertile country, well tilled and with great vineyards.
Only two towns of importance were passed,
San Bernardo with 8269 inhabitants which also has street-car
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264'>[264]</a></span>
connection with Santiago and Buin whose population
is 2713 inhabitants and is the county seat of the Department
of Maipo in the Province of O'Higgins. The Andean
and wine-producing province of O'Higgins, named in
honor of the father of Chilean independence lies directly
south of the rather large Province of Santiago, its boundary
line being the Maipo River. Its population is 92,339.</p>

<img src="images/i-290.jpg" width="376" height="457" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Calle Brazil, Rancagua</p>
</div>

<p>
Rancagua, the provincial capital, is a dirty, odoriferous,
dilapidated adobe city of 10,380 people with the outward
appearance of decay. A walk down the main street
which is named Brazil belies the general appearance of the
town for its sidewalks throng with peasants from whose
shoulders hang multicolored shawls. Horsemen wearing
red ponchos, their spurs clanking, trot down the pebble-paved
street that is lined with squalid one-story shops.
Although only fifty-four miles south of Santiago, the place
is a good market town; of the numerous shops those that
deal in dry goods, draperies, and saddles appear to do the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265'>[265]</a></span>
most lucrative trade. There is only one respectable appearing
spot in the city, and that is the small plaza in the urban
center which is embellished by a bronze equestrian statue
of O'Higgins, his horse trampling a Spaniard. Of the
several apologies for hotels, none were inviting and rather
than to eat at one of their restaurants, it is best to go
hungry. The only decent place to eat is at the railroad
station. One of the taverns is named "The North American"
with a proprietor of our own nationality but its
business is mostly bar trade, catering to the incoming
and outgoing trade of the miners at El Teniente Mine.
The day I was at Rancagua was Sunday which I was told
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266'>[266]</a></span>
was the day on which the prisoners of the jail were allowed
to receive guests. I imagine that nearly everybody in the
town either had relatives or friends in jail for in front of
the building which is on the main street a mob had collected
to await admittance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i291" id="i291"></a>
<img src="images/i-291.jpg" width="538" height="293" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Street in Rancagua</p>
</div>

<p>
The inhabitants of the town are tanned dark brown, and
although strongly built and powerful I noticed several
who were afflicted with the same malignant blood disease
which the Swiss guards imported into France from Italy
during the Middle Ages. I was also surprised to see a
little girl about twelve years old on the street who had
the leprosy, the only case I have ever seen in Chile.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The Braden Copper Company of North American
ownership has a 2½-foot gauge railroad that runs up to
their copper mine, El Teniente, which is about forty-five
miles up the Cachapoal River above Rancagua; the Baths
of Cauquenes is one of their stations. This mine which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267'>[267]</a></span>
was opened in 1907 now has six hundred employees, many
of whom are from the United States and Canada.
</p>

<p>
From Rancagua the train ride of an hour and a half
first crosses the Plain where fat cattle graze in knee high
clover, and then skirts along the ledge of the mountains
overlooking the broad terraces or selvas of the Cachapoal
River, winding around promontories on a roadbed no
wider than the coaches; any mishap would be sufficient
to send the train rolling down the mountainside killing
all the occupants of the cars. The station of Baños,
(meaning Baths) is high above the gorge of the river.
Across the canyon on a ledge of rocks can be seen the
buildings of the thermal establishment, but before the
pedestrian gets there he must walk a good half-mile. A
foot path zigzags to the canyon bottom and an arm of the
river is crossed by a cement bridge to a rocky islet. Another
bridge, this one a swinging one, suspended above a
whirlpool brings one again to terra firma on the left bank.
One now ascends another zigzag path to a forest of elm,
ash, and locust, the foliage being so thick that the sun's
rays never penetrate it. Another suspension bridge which
spans a silvery cascade is reached and beyond it is the
hotel, a low, squat adobe building painted red, whose
many rooms open onto two patios.
</p>

<p>
The name Cauquenes is Araucanian meaning <i>wild
pigeon</i>. This bird, the <i>ectopistes migratorius</i>, sometimes
called the voyager pigeon or the wood pigeon originally
had its range from Labrador to the Straits of Magellan.
Half a century ago they were numerous in the United
States, but in this country they have been absolutely
exterminated due to their having been killed off by hunters;
great numbers which escaped the gun were burned in
the Arkansas forest fires four decades ago. Chile is the
only country on the face of this earth where they still
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268'>[268]</a></span>
exist, and it is probable that they will continue to live
there as the inhabitants are extremely averse to killing
them, the ignorant classes believing that they bring good
luck and that it is an ill omen to kill them. At the present
time they are not found in Chile north of Cauquenes;
formerly there were great numbers in the vicinity of the
Cachapoal hence the name of the baths.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i293" id="i293"></a>
<img src="images/i-293.jpg" width="540" height="322" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Gorge of the Cachapoal at Baños de Cauquenes</p>
</div>

<p>
The Baths of Cauquenes are situated in the Department
of Caupolican in the Province of Colchagua on the south
or left bank of the Cachapoal River in Latitude 34° 14´ 17´´
south and in Longitude 70° 34´ 5´´ west of Greenwich.
The altitude of the place above sea level has been a matter
of argument. Eight different professors claim its altitude
in different figures from 2200 feet which is the lowest and
which is said by Domeyko to be correct, to 2762 feet which
is the highest and is said by Gillis to be correct. 2490
feet which is the altitude claimed by Guessfelt seems to be
the most exact and is the figure accepted by Dr. Louis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269'>[269]</a></span>
Darapsky in his book, <i>Mineral Waters of Chile</i>. The season
for the baths is from September 15th to May 31st, and
in midsummer the place is generally crowded. Describing
the scenery, Don José Victorino Lastarria, an illustrious
newspaper man of Santiago, says:
</p>

<p>
"I have never seen a more impressing, and at the same
time, a more charming landscape than that of the Baths of
Cauquenes, nor have I ever seen in so small a space so
many different kinds of views nor such surprising details.
Nature has grouped there her most beautiful accidents.
In sight of the snowy Andes, here rise in the foreground
rounded hills covered with vegetation; there rise barren
rocks through whose clefts rushes the turbulent Cachapoal.
Here are gardens filled with flowers; there are impenetrable
thickets. Light and shadows everywhere, colors without
end, harmony and contrast which reflect or darken the
rays of the sun."
</p>

<p>
The temperature is consistent and the variation during
the day is neither rapid nor extreme although the mornings
and evenings are cool and it is warm at midday.
Even in the hottest months the heat is not irksome, due to
the fresh breezes which blow down the valley from the
cordilleras. In winter there is snow; the cold, however, is
not excessive.
</p>

<p>
The baths have been known since 1646, and were described
by Padre Ovalle in his <i>History of the Kingdom of
Chile</i>. There are three hot springs issuing from the
porous and shaly rock, named Pelambre, Solitario, and
Corrimiento. Their temperatures are 122°, 113°, and
107°6' Fahrenheit respectively. They are walled up
and the waters of the first-mentioned two are run by
pipes into a swimming tank and into tubs in the thermal
establishment. During their course in the pipes Pelambre
loses 3°6' Fahrenheit of its heat and Solitario 5°4'. Their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270'>[270]</a></span>
waters more than supply their use so the water of Corrimiento
is allowed to go to waste. The thermal establishment,
though by no means primitive, is rather old-fashioned.
I was surprised to see such an attractive place as
the Baños de Cauquenes not made more of for in hot
springs and natural scenery it is the zenith of God's
works. Man also has done his share well but much
improvement can be made, all of which requires capital.
The natural lay out of the place is a paradise. It is
something like the Cserna Valley in southeastern Hungary,
but wilder and grander with also a soft touch of
nature. The hills covered with live oak, laurel, and
mesquite resemble those of California, yet are more fertile.
A shaded walk leads from the hotel to an artificial lake
bordered by fifty-five of the largest eucalyptus trees that
I have ever seen. In its center rising from the water
stand two willows. One is never absent from the swiftly
flowing Cachapoal which murmurs like the Tepl at Carlsbad,
only louder.
</p>

<p>
The baths are supposed to be beneficial in cases of gout,
diuretics, rheumatism, anemia, and so forth, although one
of the guests of the hotel evidently came there for relief
for consumption. He was a bearded man about sixty
years old and he made an unholy spectacle of himself by
coughing and expectorating on the floor of the dining room
while the other guests were eating dinner.
</p>

<p>
When I arrived at the place I was met at the door by a
young man wearing white duck trousers and a blue double-breasted
yachting coat. With the exception of his large
yellow moustache he had a most cherubic countenance
with a smooth, pink, babylike face without a wrinkle or
blemish. I afterwards discovered that this cherubic individual
had an inordinately strong passion for whiskey,
gin, and beer as well as for any drink which had as a fundamental
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271'>[271]</a></span>
principle among its ingredients, alcohol. On
several trips which I made later to the Baños de Cauquenes
in 1916 I became fairly well acquainted with this Señor
Hermann Manthey. He had arrived two years previously
on one of the German merchantmen on which he was a
steward. The ship was interned and he struck up-country
to make a living and finally evolved in becoming manager
of this hotel, as the proprietor, an old doctor had leased it
for a few years and was too wrapped up in his own private
affairs and also too lazy to give it his attention. Señor
Manthey was doing well on the small salary and large
tips he was getting but was not without ambitions. A
few months afterwards I ran across him on a few days'
vacation in Santiago, and he then was planning to get the
owner to lease the establishment to him upon the expiration
of the present lease to the doctor. The hotel with its
grounds, fine fruit orchard, springs, lake, and six thousand
acres of hilly grazing land, across which several rushing
streams of transparent water flow headlong into the
Cachapoal is owned by a gentleman in Santiago who
leases it out as he has several other large properties. He
will sell it for eighty thousand dollars which is dirt cheap.
Some day I expect to buy it and make it my home.
</p>

<p>
At the hotel there are horses to let. On one of these
I rode up a narrow valley and discovered that with
nothing but mere bridle paths leading to them, and miles
from the nearest houses, were lonely thatched and adobe
huts, the homes of poor people and charcoal burners
situated in mountain wheat fields or in clearings of a few
acres. All of a sudden while riding I had a sensation as if
the horse was trying to squat on its haunches. I reached
for a stick from a nearby limb to put life into it and
nearly lost my balance. A noise like distant thunder that
I had already heard twice that afternoon, although the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272'>[272]</a></span>
sky was cloudless, was audible, and in all directions stones
and small boulders came rolling down the mountain side.
It was a slight earthquake which the natives call <i>temblor</i>
in order to distinguish it from the great ones which they
call <i>terramoto</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the center of one of the myrtle-carpeted patios at
the hotel is a fountain encircled by an ivy-covered wall.
Here evenings bats congregate and flap their wings in the
vicinity of the faces of the guests. A party of Canadians,
employees of El Teniente Mine, were stopping at the
Baths when I was there. They filled up on liquor and
made sleep impossible for the other guests by their
sacrilegious bawling of <i>Onward Christian Soldiers</i> and
other hymns of the Episcopal Church.
</p>

<p>
On leaving Baños de Cauquenes I decided to take the
twenty-three-mile horseback ride to the station of Los
Lirios and from there take the train to southern Chile.
The country road was very stony; in some places it was a
mere cart track, while in others it was a broad avenue.
During the first part of the ride it windingly followed the
south bank of the Cachapoal and crossed two streams of
transparent water, each known by the same name, Rio
Claro. This means Clear River, and evidently the natives
thought that if the name would do for one, it would be
appropriate for the other. At every turn of the road a
small freshet was crossed, for out of every cleft or dent in
a hill gushed forth a spring. These small streams the
peasants deviated from their courses by turning them into
their gardens for irrigating purposes. The natives were
very poor all living in adobe hovels with thatched roofs.
A few acres of cattle, a dog or two, two acres of cultivated
land, and some pear trees represented all their worldly
belongings; yet they seemed very content. These peasants
as a class were the poorest people that I have ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273'>[273]</a></span>
seen as far as worldly possessions go, yet every one of
them always had a full meal at dinner time. They ate
what they raised, and where they grew crops they worked
them with infinite care. As they were too poor to buy
fertilizer, they worked a new piece of land each year,
coming back to the original piece after five years' time,
because it had then enriched itself by remaining idle.
There were many wheat fields, ripe and yellow, the sixty
bushels to an acre kind. Central Chile gets plenty of rain
but as it gets it only in the winter months, irrigation has
to be resorted to in the summer.
</p>

<p>
Halfway to Los Lirios I arrived at the hamlet of
Colihue (mispronounced by the natives Collegua) with
its adobe hovels bordering the now broad and extremely
dusty road. Everybody in rural Chile travels on horseback,
and the people I met riding were many. A man
loses caste if he journeys on foot. At Colihue another
road turns off to the left to the Lake of Cauquenes in the
mountains and which teems with fish. The road now left
the Cachapoal and after skirting some barren hills on the
right-hand side for a couple of miles it reaches the settlement
of Cauquenes a most queer place. It consists of a
great square compound of dirt which is surrounded on all
four sides by a five-foot-high adobe wall excepting where
there is a church on the west side and a few open sheds on
its east side. An estancia house stood beyond the wall on
the south side and there were some buildings beyond the
wall on the north side where the priest and his servants
lived. The highroad both entered and left this compound
by openings rent in the adobe wall. It may be possible
that this place once held a Spanish garrison, and that the
compound was the parade ground, and that the open
sheds were former stables. Everybody that I asked knew
nothing about the early history of the place.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274'>[274]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A broad avenue one mile long bordered by giant plane
trees led westward from here. Their foliage was so thick
that it made the road dark, and not seeing my way well I
rode my horse onto a pile of bricks, the impact being so
great that it nearly brought us both down. The road
emerged to a pebble river bed, then forded a river, and
wound around the sides of some high hills. Every
horseman in Chile takes a slight upward grade at a gallop
and I saw ahead of me a group of horsemen doing the
same; behind us came galloping around the curves six
horses pulling a carriage. These horses were three abreast
and on each outside leader two lackeys were mounted.
It was the doctor's wife from the Baños en route to Los
Lirios where her sister has a post station. Chileans
frequently travel on horseback, accompanied by their
servants who follow a couple of horse lengths behind
mounted on inferior animals. When the master stops,
the servant likewise does so, but with the same distance
between the two.
</p>

<p>
Los Lirios consists only of a small wooden railway
station, a warehouse, a large open horseshed around a yard
filled with wagons which is the post station, a small store,
and a saloon. To this latter place I repaired, after dismounting,
to get a glass of water after the hot dusty trip.
The building and its stock of goods were poorer than the
poorest backwoods blind pig, and yet for a third-class
license the congenial and friendly proprietor, who was
likewise barber and plied that trade in an adjacent room
in the same building, had to pay yearly two hundred
pesos ($34.12). From the appearance of the shack it did
not look as if he took in that much money a year. Some
of the moustached clientele that happened along, I called
up to the bar to have a treat on me. The proprietor
brought forth two goblets, each one being of a quart capacity,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275'>[275]</a></span>
and filled them to the brim with red wine which he
poured from a big jar. The contents of one of these goblets
sells for 8½ cents, the cheapest wine that I have ever seen.
If my surprise was great in seeing men take a quart of
wine for one drink, it was even greater when I saw them
drink it in nearly one gulp and put the goblet back on the
bar in anticipation of a duplicate. I treated them two
or three times and never once did they renege. I know
what would have happened to me if I had followed suit,
yet it seems incredible when I must state that it had
absolutely no effect on the imbibers. It is inconceivable
why a man in that part of Chile need ever touch an
intoxicant, for the sweet, balmy air and the voluptuous
appearance of Chile's maidens are sufficient to intoxicate
any normal, healthy man.
</p>

<p>
An hour after leaving Los Lirios the train arrived at
San Fernando, population 9150, the capital of the Province
of Colchagua where we had lunch. Colchagua which
has a population of 159,030 is one of the most productive
provinces of Chile, but the next two provinces
south of it, Curicó and Talca are not. It is a sorry sight
after having passed through the well-tilled, highly productive
country ever since leaving Santiago, to come
suddenly upon land that is going to waste on account of
lack of settlement. With the exception of the six northernmost
provinces of Chile, Curicó and Talca are to me the
least attractive of any of the republic. South of San
Fernando the first town of importance is Curicó, its name
meaning "Black Water" in the language of the aborigines;
then are reached Molina, population 4327; Talca, the
sixth city of Chile with a population of 42,088 inhabitants,
and San Javier in the Province of Linares which has
4898 people. This town lies about three miles east of
the railroad track but is connected to the depot by horse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276'>[276]</a></span>
cars and to Villa Alegre, the next town south of it, by
trolley.
</p>

<p>
The Andean Province of Linares and its southern
neighbor Ñuble are very important agriculturally, both
being two of the best in the republic. Their crops are
diversified, run high in percentage of measure to the hectare
and are of good quality. The capital of the Province
of Linares is the city of Linares with a population
of 11,122. It has good stores and buildings most of
which are painted pink. Like in Rancagua the samples
of merchandise on display in the shops are cloth, ponchos,
and drygoods. Although but slightly larger than
Rancagua it is a much finer town, and even though its
streets are none too clean they are far superior to those
of the capital of the Province of O'Higgins. In comparing
the two cities it is fair to say that Rancagua presents
more activity in street life and in business. There is one
hotel which is fair, the Comercio. A peculiarity about
Linares is that on the streets, especially that one on which
the railroad station faces, native women are seated in
front of portable stoves offering for sale cooked edibles
which should be eaten on the spot. I saw one man who,
when he had finished eating, left the spoon on the table
near the stove. The woman who owned it licked it dry,
and after having wiped it on her undershirt, replaced
it in a dish that would be sold to the next customer.
The native women have an art peculiar to Linares
and nonexistent anywhere else in the world of weaving a
certain delicate fiber into small baskets, jugs, and ornaments.
These woven wares are very diminutive and are
valuable only as ornaments and curiosities. They are
multicolored and are in much demand by strangers. It is
possible to buy them in Santiago but at an exorbitant price
for all that are on sale there are imported from Linares.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277'>[277]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A two-and-a-half-foot gauge railroad runs from a station
a block and a half north of the main depot to the springs
of Panimávida, two hours distant to the northeast.
Having seen those of Cauquenes, in order to augment my
education along thermal lines, it was up to me to see
Panimávida and to especially sample its mineral waters,
as its bottled water is the most widely drunk of any
mineral water in Chile. It corresponds to White Rock
and to Still Rock.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i302" id="i302"></a>
<img src="images/i-302.jpg" width="543" height="256" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Main Street of Linares</p>
</div>

<p>
The place Panimávida is nothing. It is just as if
somebody had erected a big hotel in the middle of an
Illinois or a Wisconsin landscape. The attractions are
absolutely nil. There are six practically tasteless lukewarm
springs covered over with glass tops which supply
the popular table water of Chile. These springs are the
property of the Sociedad Vinos de Santiago (Santiago
Wine Company), and as that stock company is well
capitalized the Panimávida waters are well advertised
by them. As people like to dilute their wine with seltzer,
this company has installed a carbonizing plant here,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278'>[278]</a></span>
which changes the still water into a sparkling one. The
plant with hotel is leased to a man named Hernandez, a
fine, fat, young fellow with a flowing beard. He is a
good and accommodating hotel man and gets the trade,
even having his runners meet the trains at Linares.
Panimávida is an excellent old-maids' paradise. Under
the shady roof of the patio porch they can sit, gossip, and
knit. The proverbial parrot is present and a black cat
could be easily imported. President Sanfuentes arrived
during my visit to rest up after the strenuous strain
connected with his installation. It was an ideal place
for this with nothing to distract his attention except the
broad meadows and the corrugated-iron, yellow-painted
Catholic chapel.</p>

<p>
Said His Excellency to me: "What Chile needs is
population. Here we have thousands upon thousands of
acres of the richest land in the world lying idle, because
there is nobody to cultivate it. Until we have the
proper number of inhabitants there is no use to cultivate
these lands, because Chile produces four times more of an
abundance of fruit than she can consume. You see how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279'>[279]</a></span>
cheap fruit and wine is; there is an over production.
Every year a million tons go to waste because there is
no market. She cannot export them because the United
States and Argentina are nearer to the European markets
and the freight rates would eat up the profits. As there
is a great demand for grain, people have gone more and
more into the growing of cereals but as yet this industry
is in its infancy. It should be encouraged for now there
is grown just enough wheat to meet the internal demand."
</p>

<p>
"Supposing," I asked, "that Chile had four times more
population than she now has, would she not have to
import her wheat?"
</p>

<p>
"Never," he replied, "as there are here millions of
hectares of the best wheat lands in the world that can be
bought for a song. They are now lying idle. Something
has to take the place of the timber of the southern provinces.
When it is gone it will have to be cereals."
</p>

<p>
"I believe," he continued, "in encouraging a large
immigration, chiefly from the northern countries&mdash;the
United States, Germany, Scandinavia, and Great Britain.
Their inhabitants have more initiative than the Latins
and intermarried with the natives make a strong blood.
Our people and those of all the Latin countries excepting
the Frenchmen lack initiative and that is what we need.
The Chilenos are content to live as they have lived for
decades, which is all very well but it is unprogressive.
Thanks to the British we now have a fairly large merchant
marine; to the Germans is due the credit of the
prosperous condition of the southern provinces. The
only drawback to the foreigners here is that they run too
much to cliques. They should scatter more. We should
also have more capital to start factories, but I do not believe
in, nor shall I encourage, any industry that will reap
the profits here to spend outside of the country."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280'>[280]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
A couple of hours south of Panimávida are the springs
of Quinamávida. They are said to be equally as good
as those of Panimávida, but the hotel there is poorly
managed and there is a lack of capital to well advertise
its waters.
</p>

<p>
On the return to Linares something went wrong with
the locomotive, which in appearance was similar to the
dinky engines one sees in the lumber plants at home used
in hauling lumber through the yards. A priest on the
train who had a mechanical turn of mind got out of the
car, and jumping into the engine cab soon had the locomotive
in running order, much to the amazement of the
train crew.
</p>

<p>
Southward from Linares the main line of the railroad
passes through Parral, population 10,047, San Carlos,
population 8499, Chillán, and Bulnes, population 3689.
San Carlos is famous for its melons and Bulnes is likewise
so for its wines. At San Rosendo, 315 miles south of
Santiago, the train crosses a branch of the Bio-Bio River,
which is named the Rio Claro in want of another name and
Araucania is entered.
</p>

<p>
By the name Araucania is known that part of Chile
bounded on the north by the Bio-Bio River and on the
south by the Calle-Calle River. Its eastern limit is the
peaks of the Andes and its western one is the Pacific Ocean.
In area it is about the size of the State of Maine and
comprises the provinces of Arauco, Malleco, Cautin, and
portions of those of Bio-Bio and Valdivia. The Spaniards
always spoke of this region as the <i>frontera</i>, meaning frontier,
and so to-day all Chile lying south of the Bio-Bio is
spoken thus of.
</p>

<p>
The original inhabitants of this country, the Araucanian
Indians were the bravest and most warlike of any
of the South American tribes, and it was not until 1883
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281'>[281]</a></span>
that they were finally subdued after 340 years of warfare.
Caupólican, Lautaro, and Colo-Colo, their great warriors
have been immortalized in the poem "La Araucana" by
Alonso de Ercilla. The Araucanians have intermarried
so much with the whites that their race is fast becoming
extinct although their facial characteristics and figures
are prevalent in a multitude of South Chileans. Their
political organization was as follows:
</p>

<p>
A large geographical division was called an <i>aillarehue</i>.
These aillarehues were divided into nine smaller parts,
each part being named a <i>rehue</i>. Ruling over each rehue
were two <i>toquis</i> or caciques who were responsible to the
two <i>gulmens</i> who ruled over the aillarehues. One gulmen
ruled in wartime, the other in times of peace. So also
with each toqui. The office of toqui was hereditary and
many became famous through warfare or by their wealth,
for example Colipí, Mariluán, Catrileo, and Huinca
Pinoleví.
</p>

<p>
The Araucanians had no gods with anything definite
attributed to them, nor did they have temples and idols,
but they were exceptionally superstitious. Their principal
god was Pillan, god of thunder, light, and destruction.
He lived in the highest peaks of the Andes and in
the volcanos. Dependent upon him were the Huécuvus,
malignant spirits. Epunamun was the god of war. They
also practised the cult of stone worship. Their most
superstitious ceremony was Machitun or cure of the sick.
The Araucanian does not believe that a man should die
unless he is killed in battle, and when he dies a natural
death through old age or sickness they believe that some
of their own people inimicable to the deceased caused him
to die. In order to discover the malefactor, they consult
a witch doctor, generally an old hag named a <i>machi</i>.
After having indulged in a number of ridiculous contortions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282'>[282]</a></span>
and jumps she names the supposedly guilty party.
Without any further ceremony they pounce on him and
amidst a great drunken orgy and libations of <i>chicha</i> (a
native intoxicant) dedicated to Pillan they torture the
innocent victim to death. When a man dies they generally
perform a post-mortem examination upon the corpse
to endeavor to extract the poison from it which caused
death. The burial takes place with great lamentation
and imbibitions of oceans of chicha to the tune of a lugubrious
musical instrument somewhat like a drum and
named a <i>trutruca</i>. They believe in an everlasting future
devoted to earthly pleasures. They formerly believed
that the deceased came to life again and dwelt on the
island of Mocha off the coast, but they changed their
thought when they discovered that the Spanish pirates
formerly used that island as their base for excursions on
the mainland. Marriage among the Araucanians has for
some time past been a true compact, the father of the bride
having to give his consent. It is not necessary for any
other members of the family to be consulted, but it often
happens that after the marriage has taken place, fights
arise between the groom and the brothers-in-law who
objected, several parties being severely wounded in these
affrays. The plight of woman is miserable; she is practically
a slave and the husband enjoys the fruits of her
labor. Polygamy exists among them.</p>

<p class='caption'>Bridge over the Malleco River at Collipulli</p>
</div>

<p>
South of the Bio-Bio the landscape changes nearly
entirely. The flat, cultivated plains of the river pockets
which form the great central valley now give place to rolling
hills intersected by small streams which lie deep in
canyons spanned by bridges. At first there are evidences
of viticulture on the side hills but these soon disappear
as well as the trees, which now only are seen near the river
beds. This absolutely treeless country of rounded hills
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283'>[283]</a></span>
swelters in the hot sun as it beats down upon the infinite
miles of yellow wheat fields. In the villages frame houses
take the place of adobe ones. There are numerous small
lumber yards and sawmills which bear testimony that in
the distant mountains there is still timber. Occasionally
a deserted sawmill is passed which shows that the lumbermen
are in the same fix as those at home, namely that a
new location must be found.
</p>

<p>
At Santa Fé, the junction of a branch railway that runs
to Los Angeles, of typhoid-fever fame, and the capital of
the Province of Bio-Bio, a curious incident happened. A
coffin had been taken off an incoming train to be put in our
baggage car. Coffins in Chile are kite shaped and are not
placed in boxes when transported. The top is not nailed
but is fitted into a groove. I stood a couple of yards away
watching the train crew lift this coffin into the baggage
car. They had to lift it slantingly as some baggage stood
in the way. Suddenly the train gave a jolt causing one
of the baggage men to lose his footing. Since there was
nobody now at the head of the coffin it fell onto the platform,
the lid came off, and the malodorous and semi-decomposed
cadaver rolled on top of the baggage man who
emitted awful shrieks and howls. The two other men
helping him immediately took to their heels. Women
screamed, men ran, natives crossed themselves, and Germans
laughed. The pinned-down baggage man howlingly
extricated himself from beneath the corpse and made all
haste to jump on the train which had now started, leaving
the lich on the platform since nobody would go near it.
</p>

<p>
At Renaico where there is a large frame depot and
restaurant, a branch line runs southwest to Angol, capital
of the Province of Malleco and continues to Traiguén. At
Collipulli, meaning "Red Earth" which has 3005 inhabitants,
the train crosses the great viaduct over the Malleco
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285'>[285]</a></span>
River which lies deep at our feet, bordered by a dark fringe
of oaks. This is the most beautiful vale in Chile. The
clear, narrow, foaming river is a refreshing sight. A rich
man has built a villa on the rise of ground overlooking
the stream which gives the scenery a touch of the Rhein.
</p>

<p>
The landscape now changes again. Oak, laurel, and
<i>lingue</i> appear, at first scattered, then in groves, and later
in forests, while everywhere possible in clearings are oat
fields, the grain just turning color. The farther south we
go the greener the grain is, until we reach Victoria, population
9840, where the grain has not begun to change color.
Every three years the farmers cut off the branches from the
laurels; these they scatter over their fields and set fire to.
Among the ashes they drag the grain into the ground for
by this procedure they are supposed to harvest better
crops. Land here is worth eighty dollars an acre. The
landscape is decidedly like that of our Northern States,
and the climate is much the same as that of Oregon and
Washington. At dusk Lautaro in the Province of Cautin
was reached. This town has a population of 5968 and is
named after Valdivia's Araucanian horse boy who murdered
him and as tradition says ate him. As I mentioned
before all the towns that we passed through south of the
Bio-Bio are built of wood, but up to here their roofs were
of tile, with a few exceptions of corrugated iron, tin, and
shingles. The tile roofs now entirely disappear and their
place is taken by those of shingles or slabs of lumber. The
houses are unpainted and as to external appearances are
veritable hovels. They resemble those dilapidated structures
of the nigger villages in our Gulf States. Many
towns resemble the one-time lumber settlements of the
upper peninsula of Michigan.
</p>

<p>
On the train I became acquainted with the Reverend
Steerer, a divine of the Church of England who had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286'>[286]</a></span>
resided for twenty-six years in Temuco and who gave me
valuable information about the country. He had just
returned from a trip to the mountains at the request of the
British Consul in Concepcion who had sent him there to
inquire into the mystery surrounding the murder of an
Englishman who was stabbed to death in bed by some
natives who wanted the money he had on him.
</p>

<p>
At Temuco the Cautin River is reached. The country
around here has had a troubled history in the wars between
the Araucanians and the whites. One of the anecdotes
is that on July 31, 1849, the bark <i>Joven Daniel</i> ran into
some rocks near the mouth of the river and was shipwrecked.
The cacique Curin lived near the spot and with
the help of his tribesmen they saved the lives of the crew
and passengers together with the cargo which was given
to them out of gratitude. In the cargo was liquor which
they immediately attacked. Under its influence they
murdered every survivor except an eighteen-year-old girl,
Elisa Bravo of Valparaiso, whom Curin selected to be one
of his wives. She was betrothed to a Ramón Bañados of
Valparaiso. His family immediately took up the matter
with the government which immediately got into action
to chastise the Araucanians. Dissentions had in the
meantime arisen among the Indians, and two caciques,
Loncomilla and Huaquinpan took the side of the whites.
The Araucanians were beaten but no trace of Elisa Bravo
was ever found as it was supposed that Curin married her
and took her to a place of safety.
</p>

<p>
Another incident happened in 1861. A French adventurer
named Aurelie de Tournes proclaimed himself
King of Araucania under the title of Orelie I. He promised
to free the Indians from the Chilean rule and had
the ability to get the aid of several caciques and quite a
large following. In a battle he was taken prisoner; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287'>[287]</a></span>
was tried for menacing public safety and would likely have
been executed if it had not been for the intercession of the
members of the French colony in Santiago, and of a judge
who has previously declared him to be insane.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i312" id="i312"></a>
<img src="images/i-312.jpg" width="376" height="495" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Street in Temuco</p>
</div>

<p>
Temuco is the capital of the Province of Cautin and is
the geographical capital of Araucania. It is the largest
city of Chile south of the Bio-Bio and has a population
of 29,557, ranking ninth in the republic. It is 422 miles
south of Santiago, and owes its origin to a fort which
was built here in 1881. In recent years its growth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288'>[288]</a></span>
has been rapid. The city is situated west of the mainline
of the longitudinal railroad, and is the junction for a
branch line that runs to the town of Imperial. There is a
considerable English colony which has a church and two
schools, but like all over in southern Chile, the Teutonic
element outnumbers all the rest of foreigners in a ratio of
ten to one. The business is mostly in the hands of the
Germans as can be seen by the names over the stores.
Somebody with a Yiddish streak must have strolled in
from somewhere because I noticed the sign of Benjamin
Goldenberg over the door of a second-hand clothing shop.
The city is a long-strung-out place of frame unpainted
buildings presenting a most unattractive appearance; only
in the center of the town one gets away from these eyesores
for there brick and cement structures abound,
especially in the neighborhood of the Plaza Anibal Pinto.
The principal streets, Jeneral Bulnes, Arturo Prat, and
several others are well paved with cobblestones over which
horse cars rattle in the long ride to the railroad station.
Driving from this station to the town the hotel omnibuses
race each other much to the fright of the uninitiated
stranger. Temuco boasts of an excellent hotel, the Central,
owned by a large, fat German named Finsterbusch,
whose facial adornment is a big aureate moustache.
Like most of the Chilean hotels owned by Germans the
place is clean, the beer good, and the cuisine excellent.
</p>

<p>
The 109-mile train ride from Temuco to Valdivia is
made in four and a quarter hours through a country
entirely different from any that is passed through from
Santiago to this point. The low mountains come in such
close proximity to the railroad track that one is pierced
by a tunnel. They are heavily timbered with trees of
good saw-log size, laurel and oak abounding. The only
place of importance on the stretch is the sawmill town of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289'>[289]</a></span>
Loncoche. The valley bottoms are impenetrable jungles
of vines, bushes, thorns, and berry plants which reach a
height of about twenty-five feet. It took the pioneers a
month to traverse ten miles of this wilderness whose
bottom is soggy muck, the average day's penetration
being but one third of a mile. Antilhue is the junction
for trains running south. The Calle-Calle River is crossed
and its south bank is followed into Valdivia through a
fragrant country covered with scarlet wild fuchsias, honeysuckles,
snapdragons, and morning-glories. On all sides are
the green mountains covered with primeval forests.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i314" id="i314"></a>
<img src="images/i-314.jpg" width="541" height="320" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Plaza de la Republica, Valdivia</p>
</div>

<p>
Valdivia has had its share of the world's vicissitudes and
calamities. It was founded in 1552 by Pedro de Valdivia
and was abandoned in 1554 on account of the attacks on it
by the Araucanians who captured its founder and put him
to death by torture. It was destroyed by an earthquake
in 1575, and when rebuilt was sacked by Elias Harckmans,
a Dutchman who fortified it. In 1645 the Dutch were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290'>[290]</a></span>
worsted in a fight with the troops of the Peruvian viceroy,
the Marquis de Mancera who drove them out. There
was another earthquake in 1737 which again destroyed
the place. Rebuilt, it was burned in 1748. In 1837 a
third earthquake destroyed it. Since then it has burned
down three times, in 1840, in 1885, and in 1911, the last
one being an especially bad fire, wiping out the entire city.
Thus it has been destroyed by earthquakes three times and
burned four times.
</p>

<p>
It is beautifully situated on the south bank of the Calle-Calle
which is navigable for small boats. The city is
uninteresting as it is absolutely modern. In character it
is German, for it is the leading German center in Chile.
No other language is heard spoken on the main streets.
The natives who slightly outnumber the Teutons and also
speak German are to be found mostly on the back streets;
they are employed by the Germans in the different industries.
The population of Valdivia which is the tenth city
in Chile is 24,743.
</p>

<p>
When one alights at the railroad station, it is better to
take a launch to the city to the tune of sixty centavos
(10 cents) than by the more arduous and long trip by cab
over rough plank pavements. These launches owned by a
man named Oettinger give the stranger a pleasant ride
down the river and disembark him at a new cement quay
near the center of the city from which place boys carry the
grips to the various hotels. One is immediately impressed
by the cleanliness of the cobble stone-paved streets of the
business section and by the handsome though inexpensive
structures. It is by far the cleanest city in Chile. With
the exception of the buildings on the streets near the
Plaza de la Republica, which are of cement construction,
all the other buildings are of frame or corrugated iron, or
of both, but painted freshly over. The side streets are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291'>[291]</a></span>
paved with wooden planks, and in some places with
wooden beams, six by sixes. The main industry is brewing.
The colossal brewery named Compañia Cerveceria
Valdivia, formerly that of Anwandter Brothers, one of the
largest in Chile, looms up majestically on the water front
across the narrow river opposite the landing quay. The
storerooms for this amber and nut-brown beverage are
on the city side of the river at the dock. The best hotel
in Valdivia is the Carlos Bussenius, named after the host
who in appearance could pass as a twin brother of Finsterbusch
in Temuco.</p>

A pleasant trip from Valdivia is the two hours' ride down
the river to Corral but another and far grander is that to
Lake Riñihue and across the mountains to the wretched
hamlet of San Martin de los Andes in the greatly overrated
southern part of Argentina known as Patagonia.</p>

<p>
I left Valdivia about the middle of an afternoon and got
off the train an hour and a half later at the station of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292'>[292]</a></span>
Collilelfu where I put up for the night at a wooden shack
with a tin roof which was an apology for a hotel. Early
the next morning I arose to catch the seven-thirty train
for Huidif, the railroad terminus of the branch line which
will in time be continued to Lake Riñihue. The ride of an
hour only brought the train to its destination where the
passengers alighted to change into carriages which cover
the six remaining miles to the lake in three quarters of the
time. The whole landscape is rolling and is semiforested,
and as the lake is approached vast marshes abounding in
wild fowl are traversed. Lake Riñihue is about fifteen
miles long by four miles broad and is a favorite summer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293'>[293]</a></span>
resort for the inhabitants of Valdivia. The landscape is
beautified by vistas of the snow-capped volcanos, Choshuenco
and Mocho.</p>

<p>
The seventy-five-mile trip to Osorno from Valdivia consumes
four hours and lies through a smiling farming
country with villages, farms, and soils characteristic to
those of the best part of Wisconsin. It was dusk
when I arrived at Osorno, metropolis of the Province
of Llanquihue. The city has a population of about
12,000 and is 601 miles south of Santiago. A daily train
makes the entire distance in 25 hours and 40 minutes, a
sleeper being attached to the train as far as Renaico.
Osorno is a miserable-looking place of frame buildings
built close together as is the custom in all the towns of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294'>[294]</a></span>
southern Chile where lumber plays the main rôle in the
erection of edifices; but few of the houses and stores are
painted. Valdivia is the only place in this section of the
country where the inhabitants take enough pride in the
appearance of their town to give the houses a fresh coat of
paint. I was told by Bussenius to go to a German hotel
which had just been opened by a former chef of one of
the interned Kosmos Line steamers. I did not go there,
however, because Americans do not stand in good repute
with the Germans and Chilenos of German descent in
southern Chile. Although the United States was not at
war with Germany at the time of my visit, nevertheless the
Teutonic inhabitants of that section took pains to show
their dislike of North Americans. Although I was subjected
to no personal discourtesy at either Temuco or Valdivia,
but on the contrary was treated well, I was obliged
to listen to much tirade against the United States and
the inhabitants of our country in general. The Germans
were angered because North American firms were supplying
the Entente with munitions of war and it was a current
topic of conversation among them that the United States
was afraid to declare war upon Germany, saying that if it
did so there would be an uprising there against its Government
by the great number of Germans and Americans of
German extraction. They anticipated a Bürgerkrieg or
Civil War in the United States if the latter joined sides
with Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
As there were a couple of spruce-looking runners at the
railway station for the Hotel Royal, a native hostelry, I
gave them my grips and was driven through the unprepossessing
streets of the city. The cab eventually stopped in
front of a building that has the outward appearance of a certain
large residence on the outskirts of Ashland, Wisconsin,
where lumberjacks and sailors were wont to congregate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295'>[295]</a></span>
after pay days and sojourn until their savings were gone.
I was wondering whether this establishment was of the
same nature. Fortunately it turned out to be a very good
and comfortable hotel, absolutely Chilean. Osorno has
several other hotels, all German. Osorno has more
Teutons in proportion to its size than any city in Chile.
In numbers, Valdivia has a larger German population, but
the ratio is smaller for Valdivia is the larger place. Three-quarters
of Osorno's population is German, their numbers
here being in excess of nine thousand. In southern Chile
where most of the hotel-keepers are German, the inns all
have the Gastzimmer or Bürgerzimmer as in Germany,
where the merchants and clerks assemble nights to discuss
news and the events of the day over large schupers of
health-giving beer. A non-trust brewery has recently
been inaugurated in Osorno by a man named Aubel and
his wet goods certainly hit the right spot when partaken of.
Outside of his brewery there is no manufacturing in the
town excepting the large flour mill of Williamson and
Balfour. Both these enterprises were born in 1914.</p>

<p>
While standing on the plaza one night listening to the
military band, all at once was heard the pealing of bells
and booming of gongs. Everybody started to run in all
directions and not knowing what was taking place, thinking
it was either an earthquake or a revolution, I followed
suit and hid behind a maple tree. This scare turned out
to be a fire alarm. The whole crowd now raced and tore
down a street that leads across the railroad track, and I
presently saw by the blaze that the fire was of no small
importance. Slipping up to my room I took my valuables
from my valise, and putting them in my pocket joined the
crowd. Above the din of conversations, orders from the
police, and the noise from the fire pumps, could be heard
the agonizing screams of four victims that were being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297'>[297]</a></span>
burned to death at the windows of the second story of a
dwelling. They were caught like rats in a trap while
asleep, and when aid came they were beyond all mortal
help. The policemen standing in the road with drawn
sabers suddenly ordered the crowd to run for their lives,
which they did in all directions. An intonation like the
sound of a cannon boomed, followed by two or three
sharper reports. Impossible for the firemen to stop the
fire which was spreading to all the neighboring closely
packed frame dwellings, the police had started dynamiting.
This last process which was successful claimed another
victim and blinded another person. I saw the remains
of the dynamite victim; what remained of him resembled a
pudding. No vestige of either teeth or bones was found
of the four persons who perished in the fire and whose heart-rending
screams are now ringing in my ears.</p>

<p class='caption'>Scenery on the Railroad Between Osorno and Puerto Montt</p>
</div>

<p>
All the small towns of southern Chile have flour mills
and grain elevators; throughout the countryside on the
farms and in the towns are seen tall block houses, reminiscenses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298'>[298]</a></span>
of the days of Indian warfare. From Osorno the
railroad continues ninety-three miles southward to Puerto
Montt, the terminus of the longitudinal railroad southward.
Puerto Montt, with 5408 inhabitants, is the capital
of the Province of Llanquihue. It lies on the north end
of Reloncaví Bay, 694 miles south of Santiago, and is an
uninteresting modern frame town, inhabited mainly by
Germans. When a southeaster blows the breakers beat
with terrific force against the docks.
</p>

<p>
Small vessels belonging to a local navigation firm ply
thrice weekly between Puerto Montt and Ancud, the capital
of the Province and the Island of Chiloé which lies
eighty miles to the southwest on the extreme northern
end of the Chiloé archipelago, on the Bay of Ancud.
Large ships of the Compañia Sud-Americana de Vapores,
generally known as the Chilean Line, also make both
Puerto Montt and Ancud weekly, while those of intermediate
size sail from Puerto Montt and make all the small
ports on the Gulf of Corcovado en route to Punta Arenas.
At eight o'clock in the morning following the day that I
arrived in Puerto Montt, I boarded the steamer <i>Chacao</i>
in a blinding downpour of rain with a ticket for Ancud
which cost about $1.20 in the equivalent of our currency.
The sea was not rough but was rather choppy, while the
rain prevented the passengers from remaining on deck.
Unfortunately the clouds hung too low to permit me to
get a good view of the mainland. The islands of Maillen
and Guar were skirted and three hours out we anchored off
the port of Calbuco, county seat of the Department of
Carelmapu in the Province of Llanquihue. This town is
situated on a peninsula at the south end of the Bay of
Reloncaví and from the steamer deck resembled the
lumber villages of Puget Sound. It is connected with
Puerto Montt by a rough wagon road and there is talk of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299'>[299]</a></span>
extending the railroad here, although I can see no reason
for its necessity, excepting that the harbor at Calbuco is
sheltered while that of Puerto Montt is not. The difficulties
of engineering and the cost of construction, I imagine,
would never make it pay. Shortly after leaving
Calbuco we entered the Gulf of Ancud and after skirting
the south end of Llanquihue entered the narrow roadstead
of Chacao, and arrived at the hamlet of that name about
two o'clock in the afternoon. Chacao was founded in
1567 and until about fifty years ago was the principal port
of Chiloé when it was practically deserted in favor of
Ancud whose growth at that time had been rapid, and
which owing to its being a port on the Pacific Ocean was
fast getting the commerce.
</p>

<p>
Ancud was reached about four o'clock in the afternoon
after a trip that consumed eight hours. It lies at the
south end of the bay of the same name, an indentation of
the ocean, and is protected from the dreaded southeasters
by a mountainous headland named Lacui. The bay is
filling up so fast with mud which is washed into it by the
rains, that vessels of large draught have to anchor from one
to two miles out. Our ship anchored about half a mile
out and we were transferred to terra firma by gasoline
launches. The village has 3424 inhabitants and is a dirty
settlement smelling of dried fish, built on the side of a hill.
It is the seat of a bishopric, the frame cathedral being the
best building in the town. There is absolutely nothing
to do in the place which for amusement has but one moving
picture theater. Numbers of mixed bloods and Indians
are in evidence seemingly outnumbering the whites, many
of the latter being Germans.
</p>

<p>
Chiloé has an area of 8593 square miles, being larger than
the State of Massachusetts; its population is slightly in
excess of eighty thousand inhabitants many of whom are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300'>[300]</a></span>
Indians. These Indians are not warlike like the Araucanians
nor are their physiques as good. Their numbers are
on the decrease owing to alcoholism and to diseases which
always follow in the wake of the advent of the white men.
A continuation of the Coast Range, the Cordillera de
Pinchué runs the extreme length of Chiloé from north to
south, its summits from 1500 to 2000 feet in altitude being
near the Pacific Coast which is inhospitable and has no
harbors. The east coast of the island, separated by
the thirty-five-mile-wide Gulfs of Ancud and Corcovado
abounds in good harbors and it is here that the settlements
are. These gulfs teem with small mountainous islands,
most of them being uninhabited.
</p>

<p>
A railroad runs southward from Ancud sixty-five miles
to Castro, the distance being made in four hours. There
are no towns on the route but numerous stops are made at
small settlements such as Quichitue, Puntra, Quildico, and
Dalcahue. Midway between Ancud and Castro are the
Puntra and Putalcura River valleys of great fertility.
Here are many farmhouses with fields of green oats and
with pastures of clover in which feed droves of cattle and
swine. Hides are one of the chief exports of the island.
Where there are no clearings the forests are primeval
and are beautiful in their green coloring. It is a dripping
forest of moisture with lianas, giant ferns, purple and
crimson fuchsias, and species of orchids. The bark of the
tree trunks and of the windfalls are covered with inch-deep
moss. The density of the woods and the exuberance
of plant growth is the nearest approach to a tropical forest
imaginable in a temperate zone for the whole island of
Chiloé lies south of Latitude 42° South.</p>

<p class='caption'>Indian Belles, Chiloé Island, Chile</p>
</div>

<p>
Next to Ancud, the most important place on the island
is Castro which was the capital until 1834. It is the oldest
town on Chiloé and here the Spaniards made their last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301'>[301]</a></span>
stand. It is a well-built village of 1243 inhabitants, situated
on the west side of the long and narrow Putemun Bay,
and is well sheltered from the winds by the ten-mile-distant
mountains to the west. It consists of several parallel
streets running lengthwise along the bay. A wagon
road runs southeastward from here about thirty miles to
the settlement of Ahoni. I only remained a few hours in
Castro because there arrived in the afternoon a steamer
from Punta Arenas on its way to Puerto Montt. Its
route lay through the channel which separates the large
island of Lemui from Chiloé, and then took a course
eastward between several islands and rounded Cape
Chegian at the southeastern extremity of Quinchao Island.
This last mentioned island is about twenty miles long and
is very narrow excepting at its northwestern end where it
broadens out, and is separated from Chiloé by the Strait
of Quinchao. It and an archipelago of smaller islands
form a political department of which the town of Achao,
where we anchored at dusk, is the county seat. Achao has
a population of 1571 inhabitants and has taken away much
of Castro's former trade. It is a long-strung-out fishing
village on the side of a hill, the forest on which comes down
to the water's edge. Shortly after leaving Achao, the ship
sailed westward to Chiloé again and stopped at Dalcahue
on the Strait of Quinchao. Dalcahue has a road leading
to a three-miles-distant railroad station on the Ancud-Castro
line. During the night, Quincavi was touched at
and after a steam through the Gulf of Ancud and the Bay
of Reloncaví, Puerto Montt was again reached at 11 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span>
It was a nice clear morning and the snow-capped Andes
on the unexplored mainland were resplendent in sunlit
brilliancy.
</p>

<p>
On the mainland southeast of the Island of Chiloé is
Chile's largest river, the Palena. It rises from Lake
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303'>[303]</a></span>
General Paz, whose waters are traversed by the international
boundary line of Argentina and Chile; it flows
northward through western Patagonia and bending to the
west after a course of about thirty miles finally empties
itself into the Gulf of Corcovado. North of the Palena
and at its source, separated from it by a low range of hills
in Patagonia, is the Futaleufu River whose origin is in the
Argentine Valley of the 16th of October. It flows westward
through the Andes into Lake Yelcho which in turn
empties into the Yelcho River. This river finds its
way into the Gulf of Corcovado south of the Quinchao
Archipelago.
</p>

<p>
The person who visits Chile and returns home without
having seen the Llanquihue lake region has made his trip
in vain. Here is a country as grand as Switzerland,
which although its mountains are not quite so high, they
seem higher and are better for vistas for the valleys are
lower. Moreover the snow line is here lower. In Switzerland
one gets the best views of the giant peaks from
altitudes of valley bottoms that are themselves six thousand
feet and over above sea level; here one gets the same
view from low-lying rivers and lakes which makes the sheer
abruptness grander. There are no great thick forests in
Switzerland which are here omnipresent, garbing the
mountain sides from the barren, snow-capped peaks down
to the very water's edge. This Llanquihue country is
beginning to become popular with excursionists and it
will not be long before it will be one of the world's famous
playgrounds.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-one miles north of Puerto Montt on the railroad
to Osorno is the large triangular Lake Llanquihue,
much indented with bays and coves on its western shore.
Its breadth is over thirty miles, and it is the largest freshwater
lake in Chile. Its outlet is the Maullin River which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304'>[304]</a></span>
flows in a southwesterly direction into the ocean to the
north of the Bay of Ancud. The scenery in the neighborhood
of the lake is most charming. The west and north
shores is a rolling country much of which is cleared into
farms, well kept up and showing a high degree of prosperity.
From the south shore rises a steep incline tapering
towards the top into the conical snow-capped volcano,
Calbuco, whose lower reaches are embowered in forests of
hardwood. Many small streams rush from its sides and
pour into the lake. At the eastern extremity rises the
mighty, majestic dome of the volcano, Osorno, rising
8645 feet, nearly perpendicularly from the clear waters.</p>

<p class='caption'>Lake Todos Santos from Petrohué</p>
</div>

<p>
Puerto Varas at the southwestern end of the lake is the
summer resort where the travellers leave the train. It is
a clean little village of frame houses in the heart of a country
renowned for its frutillas, or diminutive wild strawberry
which grows here in abundance, and whose name
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305'>[305]</a></span>
should not be confounded with <i>fresas</i>, which is the name
for the strawberry of larger size which we are acquainted
with. The whole region is a German settlement, and this
is especially true at Puerto Varas where scarcely anybody
of any other nationality is seen excepting some of the
laborers. The Bellavista is the best hotel. It is a clean,
comfortable house where the proprietor is a professional
landscape photographer. Transportation of passengers
to San Carlos de Bariloche in Argentina is effected thrice
weekly during the summer season and once a week the
remainder of the year. A little steamer belonging to the
South Andes Transportation Company leaves Puerto
Varas at 8 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span>, and after a four hours' steam across the
placid waters of Lake Llanquihue brings one at Ensenada
at the base of Mount Osorno in time for luncheon. Here
one now has the choice of a carriage or horseback ride to
the twelve-mile-distant Lake of Todos Santos (All Saints).
This short journey crosses a saddle of the divide between
Lake Llanquihue and the valley of the Petrohué River, of
which Lake Todos Santos and its tributaries are its source.
This ride is over a road which in wet seasons is poor and
full of ruts but is decidedly charming on account of the
darkness of the forest which comes down to both sides of it.
The Petrohué River of unsurpassing beauty winds in a
gorge between the high Santo Domingo Mountain and
the Calbuco Volcano, and empties itself into the fiord
like Reloncaví River. Behind a mountain chain to the
west of which Calbuco is the culminating pinnacle, is the
large and beautiful Lake Chapo, nearly inaccessible owing
to the steepness of the mountain sides which have to be
climbed first in order to get a view of it.</p>

<p class='caption'>Puella</p>
</div>

<p>
At Petrochué which is reached at 3 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> there is nothing
but a dock from which one embarks on another small
steamer that takes one in four hours more to Puella at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306'>[306]</a></span>
eastern end of Todos Santos Lake. The lake is long and
narrow with several arms running like the legs of a spider
up into the pockets of the mountains which are formed as
their sides dip to unite with one another. The verdure of
the forests is dark and primeval, while the water itself is
dark blue with barely a ripple on its surface. The appearance
of the entire landscape is somber and mysterious. A
small round island, named Isla de las Cabras, rises precipitously
in woodland glory from the center of the lake.
Ever present in the distance are snow-crowned domes,
those of Osorno and Santo Domingo behind us to the west,
while in front of us rises the awe-inspiring rugged peak of
El Tronador (the Thunderer) white in its icy altitude of
glaciers. At Puella is a primitive hotel where the traveller
stops for the night. This place is at the very foot of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307'>[307]</a></span>
Thunderer, so named from the loud intonations caused by
the glaciers breaking off at their edges and falling with
roars into the ravines. El Tronador is 11,278 feet high;
its summit is only ten miles from the deep-lying lake.
Thus one can imagine its great perpendicular steepness.
This continues downward for an infinite depth in the lake,
whose banks are so sheer in many places that it is impossible
to obtain a foothold. The bottom of Todos Santos
Lake has never been found although it is believed to
exceed a thousand feet in depth. The water made by
mountain springs and eternal snows is so cold that swimming
is impossible. About a third of a mile from the
hotel at Puella is a large waterfall, while at frequent intervals
throughout the sublime landscape are numerous falls
and cascades.
</p>

<p>
Taking an early start from Puella, one arrives by carriage
or mules in two and a half hours' time at Casa-Pangue,
a small frame chalet where are stationed the Chilean
custom-house officers. From here to the international
boundary at the top of the divide is an ascent of about
two thousand feet, the road lying through a thick forest.
It takes two hours to reach the summit where there is an
iron post with a sign on one side of which is the word Chile
while on the other side is Argentina. The divide is covered
with snow from May till September which on the
hillsides reaches a great depth. Not far from the international
boundary marker on the descent is a crude
wooden cross, which denotes the burial place of workmen
who died in a snowstorm while constructing the road.
</p>

<p>
About halfway down the descent one suddenly perceives
through the thick foliage the turquoise blue of Lake Frio.
This lake fed by the torrential Frio River derives its name
from the frigidity of its waters whose origin is the glacier
on the east slopes of El Tronador. A launch is waiting at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308'>[308]</a></span>
a pier to ferry passengers across it which takes about
twenty minutes. A road follows the left bank of the lake,
but it is not passable for carriages; it is used now for freight
only. Rounded rails lie on it parallel to each other and
over them pass the concave surfaces of bullock carts. All
passengers were formerly transported this way. A couple
of miles beyond Lake Frio the western extremity of Lake
Nahuel Huapi, Argentina's largest lake is reached at the
hamlet of Puerto Blest by means of a mule-back ride.</p>

Puerto Blest consists only of a dock and a frame building
which is the rest house for travelers and which is
owned by the South Andes Transportation Company.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309'>[309]</a></span>
Here one stops for the night to continue on the following
morning the four-hours' steamer trip to the thirty-mile-distant
Argentine town of San Carlos de Bariloche. Lake
Nahuel Huapi is over fifty miles long by seven miles wide
at its broadest place, and is very irregular in shape, having
many antennæ or arms which reach into the mountain
depressions. In its center is a large island whose proper
name is Victoria Island. It is long, wooded, and mountainous
and comprises about ten thousand acres. The Chileans
call it Menendez Island after the wealthy family of
Menendez whose seat is in Punta Arenas, and who formerly
owned much property across the Chilean frontier
not far from the lake. The Argentine government made a
present of this island to a Señor Anchorena of Buenos
Aires upon condition that in ten years time he would
expend on it for improvements eighty-eight thousand
dollars which was the amount that they considered it
worth. His own idea, which he has carried out, was to
make Victoria Island a private game reservation and to
this end he has imported wild animals from the north of
Europe which have here thrived and propagated. It
abounds in deer, huanacos, and pheasants, but so far he
has not improved it commercially.

<p>
The farther eastward that one goes on Lake Nahuel
Huapi, the less beautiful and interesting the scenery
becomes. The mountains become lower, rockier, and more
treeless, until the trees become stunted and finally disappear
so that the eastern end of the lake instead of having
the beautiful sylvan nature that was omnipresent in Chile
has now the sterile aspect of the west end of the Argentina
pampa with barren mountains and plains of dried grass.
San Carlos de Bariloche is a lonesome, God-forsaken village
of about five hundred inhabitants on the south shore
of the lake. On the wide semblance of a street are rough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310'>[310]</a></span>
brick, adobe, and frame buildings with two churches, a
parochial school, a bank, and a government office. The
inn which goes by the name of Hotel Perito-Moreno is as
much a disgrace to a hostelry as San Carlos de Bariloche
is to the name town. The paper was falling off the walls
and the broken windowpanes were repaired by having
newspapers pasted over the apertures. Straw mattresses
with blankets, which I imagine teemed with vermin, took
the place of regular beds, while the food was so execrable
that it was nauseating. As the place is rarely visited by
anybody excepting cattle-buyers, it is not supposed to be
up to date.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants of wind-swept San Carlos, however,
are not complaining. They have passed that stage and
have resigned themselves to face whatever misery might
present itself to them. There is talk of the Southern
Railroad continuing from Neuquen to make the town its
terminus. This would effect another Transadine route
and open up the country to civilization. Not far from
San Carlos de Bariloche the Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe
has an eighty-thousand-acre ranch. It is said that he
bought this to make his home on in case he should be
deposed in Germany. For manager he has Baron von
Bülow, the nephew of the former Chancellor of the German
Empire.

CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="s08">CHILLÁN. ASCENT OF VOLCANO CHILLÁN</span>
</h2>

<p>
While in Santiago in 1915 I met at the Hotel Oddo, a
Señor Hugo Gumprecht who was a guest there. He is a
German by birth, but in his youth emigrated to Australia
where he married, became a naturalized British subject,
and lived there for some time. He then went to South
Africa and at the time of the Boer War enlisted in the
British Army, became an officer, and received the Victoria
Cross. When the war was over he went to Argentina and
in the village of General Alvear in the Province of Mendoza,
started a hardware store. Here he became naturalized
as a citizen of the Argentine Republic and lived there
up to a few days previous to my meeting him. Business
had become dull in Argentina and as he is an experienced
engineer he went to Chile to see if there was an opening
for him there in his line, in the meantime leaving his family
in Argentina until he would establish himself. He is an
educated man about forty-eight years old, is comfortably
well off, and in appearance is a double of Lloyd George, or
rather looks like the pictures of Lloyd George that were
taken ten years ago. When I returned to Santiago in
1916, Gumprecht was still in Santiago but living in a private
house. As he had not yet found anything to his
liking, he was about to make some trips to different parts
of the republic to see what there was doing. I intended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313'>[313]</a></span>
visiting the baths of Chillán out of curiosity and invited
him to join me, which he did. I have never yet found a
person that I have cared more to travel with than with
him.
</p>

<p>
One morning we left Santiago and eleven hours later
found ourselves in the 253-miles-distant Ñuble metropolis.
Owing to an excess of traffic the train was two hours late.
From the train in the afternoon we saw the irregular peak
of the volcano Yeguas, 11,885 feet high, in the Linares
Andes on the eastern horizon; soon afterwards appeared in
the hazy background the volcano Chillán, 9438 feet high,
whose whole conical contour is perpetually covered with
snow. Seen at the setting of the autumn sun the central
valley of Chile presents a view so pastorally charming
that its replica is difficult to be conjured by the imagination.
Broad fields of melons, intermingled with vineyards
and separated from each other by rows of Lombardy
poplars and blackberry hedges, decked the valley floor.
On the western horizon rises a chain of hills, which occasionally
has an outcrop in the form of an isolated mountain.
The sun, which had just sunk behind them, made the sky
saffron, as its rays, invisible behind the western peaks,
played upon the snowy summits of the Andes to the
east.
</p>

<p>
The crowd on the platform at the covered train shed of
the Chillán station is the most animated to be found at any
railroad station in Chile with the possible exception of that
at Llai-Llai. Landscape gardeners have endeavored to
enhance the depot approach by planting cedar trees
in square holes in the middle of the sidewalk. These
trees have attained the growth of three feet. Leaving
the depot, Gumprecht was walking on my left. Presently
he uttered an oath and upon my looking around I was just
in time to see his carcass take a plunge and land on his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314'>[314]</a></span>
belly in front of the astonished crowd. When he picked
himself up, he said:
</p>

<p>
"I felt something rise between my legs and I jumped,
but it was this <i>verdammter</i> tree."</p>

<p class='caption'>Plaza O'Higgins, Chillán</p>
</div>

<p>
Chillán is the capital of the Province of Ñuble, and
has a population of 39,113, being the seventh city of
Chile. Next to Santiago and Talca it is the largest city
in the central valley. It would be larger than Talca if it
took in its suburb, Chillán Viejo. But although a paucity
of manufacturing is done, it owes its existence as a market
town to its being the center of an agricultural district
to which it is the distributing point. There are but few
foreigners, unlike the towns farther south, so that the city
is essentially Chilean and here native life and customs
can be seen and studied at their best. There are several
specialties of home-made manufacture that owe their
origin to Chillán, preëminent among which are untanned
leather accoutrements and caparisons for the equine and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315'>[315]</a></span>
muline genera, such as bridles, whips, and spur leathers.
Chillán pottery is famous throughout the republic. It is
black, thin, and brittle, and is invariably adorned with
scroll work of pink, lemon, or white. Last in importance
is the charcoal fan, woven by natives from corn husks.
The brewery of Julius Jenson is not large enough to play a
rôle in the financial equilibrium of the place for its proprietor
brews but an ordinary beer for local trade.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i340" id="i340"></a>
<img src="images/i-340.jpg" width="547" height="272" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Calle Roble, Chillán, Looking East from Calle Arauco</p>
</div>

<p>
Although the city has no electrified street car system, its
horse cars are a duplicate of the Santiago and Valparaiso
trolley cars. They have double decks, the top being
reserved for those who prefer to travel second class. In
other means of transit there is nothing to boast of. The
hacks are antiquated, closed black wooden boxes, while
the saddle horses at the livery stables are of the antediluvian
variety.
</p>

<p>
The main streets are well paved with cobblestones, but
the side ones are poorly paved with small smooth stones,
very distressing to walk upon with thin-soled shoes. The
buildings are well built and red brick is more common than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316'>[316]</a></span>
in the cities farther north. However, there are in Chillán
frame houses, which in the neighborhood of Santiago are
conspicuous by their absence. There are several plazas,
but the principal one, O'Higgins, is the best, and in my
estimation is the loveliest in Chile. It has no grassy
sward but its great trees give a delightful umbrage that is
refreshing during the heat of a summer day. In this respect
it is not unlike the Plaza Pringles in San Luis, Argentina.
A military band plays here thrice weekly at night
and it is then a treat for tired eyes to watch from a bench
the procession of well-formed girls in the latest creations
pass by in review on their <i>corso</i> around the octagonal park.</p>

<img src="images/i-341.jpg" width="531" height="261" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Street in Chillán</p>
</div>

<p>
The market place, paved with pebbles, is a broad area,
bustling with life. Nearly every known variety of vegetable
is represented, and of such a quality that I know
nowhere else where they are excelled unless it is at the
market at Belgrade, Servia. Chillán is the greatest onion
mart in South America, and here are seen cartloads of that
nerve-soothing vegetable heaped on the ground. Many
marketeers come to town Sunday afternoon and sleep that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317'>[317]</a></span>
night in their stalls so as to be alert with their wares and
produce at daybreak on Monday, on which day the place
is thronged. On the fringe of the area are canvas booths.
Here sit toothless hags and buxom virgins offering for sale
at fabulously low prices, quirts, riatas, hobbles, spur-straps,
and other leathern productions of their deft fingers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i342" id="i342"></a>

<p class='caption'>Market Place, Chillán</p>
</div>

<p>
Regarding hotels, Chillán has some good ones, but
unless the prospective lodger telegraphs beforehand, he is
likely to find shelter beneath a shade tree for the rooms
are in constant demand. This speaks well of the city. In
the summer the natural trade is augmented by the tourists
en route to and en retour from the Termas de Chillán (Baths
of Chillán), a watering place, who spend a night or two in
the Ñuble metropolis in transit. At the exit of the old-fashioned
railway station, a runner meets the stranger
and touts for the Hotel Central, a large new building, a
block from the center of the city.
</p>

<p>
I prefer the Hotel de France and believe it is the best
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318'>[318]</a></span>
in the central valley. Its proprietor, Monsieur Pierre
Heguy, is the super-bantam cock. This handsome little
man with his coal-black beard trimmed to a goatee meets
you at the door with a smile and a bow. "<i>Voilà</i>, monsieur,"
he says, and with a stately sweeping gesture he
stands aside to allow you to inspect the best hotel bedroom
in Chile. His single-story hotel is of frame and adobe.
"But what does that matter?" he inquires and then
concludes: "In case of fire or earthquake it is much
safer than the stupendous Hotel Central. Moreover, do
water colors and oil paintings of landscapes adorn the
walls of the bedrooms at the Central the same as in the
Hotel de France? Have the Jews at the Central any
knowledge of liqueurs and champagne? <i>Sapristi</i>, no!"
and then he spat.
</p>

<p>
My bedroom on the street corner was grand and large
enough to house the august presence of an emperor and for it
I paid the equivalent of $3.40 a day, which included meals.
The carpet was of the old-fashioned kind with pink roses
whose replicas are only found to-day in the farmhouses
and in the old residences of the country towns whose
furnishing dates back two generations. The massive
wooden washstand with mirror, chest of drawers, and the
bedstand were all crowned with marble slabs. The bed
was a four-poster and the "crazy quilt" was that of
bygone days. The same bed that I occupied probably
once creaked under the weight of Lady Brassey's expatriated
figure when she visited Chillán, having left the yacht
<i>Sunbeam</i> at Talcahuano.
</p>

<p>
The cuisine is perfect and the liquid refreshments are of
the finest quality. Monsieur Heguy is a connoisseur of
those substances which tickle the palate. He does not
indulge in liquid refreshment. He did so when I first
made his acquaintance in 1913 but had to quit as it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319'>[319]</a></span>
injuring his health. At the time of my previous acquaintance
with him he would drink everything on the bill of
fare as long as somebody else was paying for it, but he
never treated when it came his turn.
</p>

<p>
One night while I was at the Hotel de France there was
a temblor or slight earthquake. I was awakened from
a sound sleep a quarter of an hour before midnight by a
noise at my door as if somebody was trying to break into
my room. Lighting a candle I saw that the key tag was
rattling. I yelled out, "Who's there?" and opened the
door but saw nobody. I jumped back into the bed again
but no sooner had I done so than I saw a streak of light
underneath the door to my right, and I heard through the
open transom of the door that opened onto the patio the
patter of feet as they crossed the tiled walk and the voice
of the young Englishwoman who occupied the adjoining
room talking to her brother and brother-in-law whose
room adjoined mine on the left.
</p>

<p>
"I think the man next door" (meaning me) "is trying
to enter my room," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Mary, you don't say so," I heard a male voice
reply.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think he would do to me if he entered my
room?" asked Mary.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure I do not know," the male voice replied.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think he would murder me?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardly that," was the reply. There was a continuance
of the conversation which I could not distinctly understand,
then the same voice continued: "Take this
revolver, and if you hear any further disturbance, shoot
through his door."
</p>

<p>
Now this was a pretty pickle. My bed was in range of
a revolver shot. I thought that some sneak thief had tried
to get into both bedrooms and had tried her door as well as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320'>[320]</a></span>
mine. Mary had supposed that it was I who wanted to
enter her room. It happened that Mary was not good
enough looking for me to have any such designs towards
her. She was slim and angular, highly colored and
commonplace, with a pointed nose and little eyes like those
of a pig. I moved my bed out of revolver range and went
to bed again. The next morning there was considerable
excitement in the town about the temblor, for it was this
that caused the rattling noise at the doors. I approached
Mary and her male relatives while they were sitting in the
patio, and telling them that I heard their conversation of
the previous night, roundly upbraided them for their
conduct, but like most unmannered persons they were
too ill-bred to apologize.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Plaza O'Higgins, another beautiful one is
that named Victoria or Santo Aldea. It is not well kept
up because the irrigation ditch which runs along the side
of an adjacent street often overflows and causes the walks
of the plaza to receive a deluge.
</p>

<p>
An interesting excursion on foot is a visit to the less than
a league distant suburb of Chillán Viejo (Old Chillán).
This foul village of five thousand inhabitants was the
original city before the earthquake of 1833 which caused
the survivors of the catastrophe to build on the present
townsite. There was an Indian settlement here before the
advent of the Spaniards. The name of their cacique was
Chiquillanes, from which the name Chillán is derived. At
Las Toscas Creek at the southern city limits of Chillán
the broad Avenida O'Higgins, which is no more than a
dusty turnpike, leads in a southwesterly direction to another
creek, that of Paso Hondo, on whose filthy banks
repose adobe reconstructions of the original town. This
place on the whole is the most poverty-stricken and
squalid town that I have ever visited, although in this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321'>[321]</a></span>
respect and in filth, it cannot compare with certain sections
and suburbs of stately Santiago. It is nine blocks
wide with an average of ten blocks long, has narrow
streets paved with sharp stones on which face tumbledown
adobe hovels. Its inhabitants are drunken, and many
possess loathsome sores on their faces. The odors rising
from the decaying matter thrown from the house doors,
the swarms of flies, and the full-bellied whippets basking in
the sun-baked offal make a person ask, "Can such things
be possible?" In those parts of the town where such
pleasantries are in the minimum, the air is redolent with
the fragrant odor of rats.
</p>

<p>
Yet Chillán Viejo is a place of reverence in the hearts of
loyal and patriotic Chilenos, for in this old town was born
the father of Chilean independence, Bernardo O'Higgins,
who with the aid of San Martin broke the Spanish dominion
in Chile. A school has been built where stood his
house, but a room of the old building has been preserved
with some of his furniture and keepsakes. A marble
tablet on the wall of the school has the following inscription
which translated into English reads:
</p>

<p>
"This house entombs a sublime echo, the whining of a
little child which was transformed into the yells of victory
at Chacabuco and Maipo.
</p>

<p>
"Here was born the father of our Independence, Don
Bernardo O'Higgins, August 20, 1778.
</p>

<p>
"Chileans, honor his memory!
</p>

<p>
"Strangers, remember our history!"
</p>

<p>
In the center of the dusty ill-kept plaza of the town,
abundant with giant ash and pepper trees, is another
memorial to this hero in the form of a bust on a pedestal
erected by a loving populace. Let it be known that
Bernard O'Higgins was one of the most unselfish and
lovable characters in military history. Born of Irish
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322'>[322]</a></span>
parentage in the squalid village of Chillán Viejo, he donated
his whole career for the welfare of his country.
After whipping the Spaniards he was made Supreme
Dictator. Unlike most other dictators he was not vainglorious
nor was he personally ambitious for power or
wealth.
</p>

<p>
The church on the plaza of Chillán Viejo is said to be
285 years old.</p>

<p>
The Province of Ñuble, of which Chillán is the capital,
has an area of 3407 square miles and a population of
166,245, being the fifth in Chile as to the number of its
inhabitants. Its eastern part is mountainous and very
sparsely settled, the great bulk of its population living
in the highly cultivated central valley. Its level lands
are a fine rich country given up to the growing of cereals,
principally wheat, and to all the vegetables known to the
temperate zone. There are also many vineyards.
</p>

<p>
The Baths of Chillán, as those hot springs are known, are
fifty-seven miles east of the city Chillán at the headwaters
of Renegado Creek on the slopes of the volcano Chillán,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323'>[323]</a></span>
5850 feet above sea level. One leaves Chillán at 5.30 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span>
and rides for two hours on a light railway which runs in a
sort of a semicircle eastward to the station of Pinto, a
distance of but twenty-two miles. At Coihueco, six miles
before reaching Pinto, the farmers are building a mutual
railway which will be a branch of the narrow gauge, the
government furnishing the rails. This is being done so
that the farmers may get their crops into Chillán. Pinto
is a large village lying about a league south of the railroad
station of the same name across the Chillán River.</p>

<p>
At Pinto passengers change from the train into carriages
and are driven to the three-miles-distant post station
of La Dehesa, where one can either continue optionally
by a seven-hour carriage drive to Las Termas (The Baths)
or by a continuation of the light railway to the hamlet of
Resinto and thence by carriage four hours to Las Termas.
The round trip by carriage costs $11.05; by train it is
$1.36 extra. I went by train which took nearly four hours
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324'>[324]</a></span>
on account of the presence on board of two inspectors
who had the locomotive stop every few minutes to give
instructions to construction gangs; from Resinto I went to
Las Termas by coach. The railroad followed the north
bank of the Chillán River until the station of Esperanza
was reached where a fine view of the smoking volcano
ahead of us was to be had; it then crossed the river and
wound along a precipice up the west bank of the Renegado
Creek, which lay below us in a forest of oak. I rode on a
flat car which by means of hay wire was coupled to the box
which served as the train coach. Resinto, formerly named
Posada, on account of the former saloon and rest house
(which in Spanish is <i>posada</i>), is the present terminus of the
light railway although it is being continued so that in this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325'>[325]</a></span>
year (1918) it is expected that it will be opened to traffic
as far as the corral of Las Trancas. The carriage road is
very rough, stony, and steep, and in some places extremely
dangerous where it winds around promontories. For the
first few miles after leaving Resinto it follows the creek
bed; at a ranch house where guides are to be obtained for
mountain excursions, a trail leads off to the south, which if
one follows it for a day and a half will bring the traveler
into Argentina over the Buraico Pass. It is only advisable
to cross the divide on mule back on account of the steepness.
From the boundary a few days' ride will bring one
to the wretched God-forsaken Patagonian settlement of
Chos Malal, in the Argentine Territory of Neuquen.</p>

<p class='caption-sub'>
This mountain has its double in the Martinswand, near Zirl, in Tirol</p>
</div>

<p>
The first stage of the drive is monotonous although the
scenery is good. There are a few scattered ranch houses
in openings in the oak woods; the country could scarcely
be called a forest, nor is it an open country. Mountains
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_326' name='Page_326'>[326]</a></span>
come down abruptly to the canyon and one of them is a
double of the Martinswand near Zirl in Tirol. The whole
trip is dusty in summer, which is the only season in which it
is possible to visit Las Termas. After leaving Las Trancas,
the station where the five horses are changed, and
from which is seen a silvery waterfall several hundred feet
high, the road enters the primeval forest of oak, elm, and
laurel, decidedly beautiful, and then winds up the cool
but dusty glen of the Renegado, which is fed by numerous
trout streams. The roaring of many cascades and waterfalls
is heard, the double one of The Lions, an hour's ride
before Las Termas is reached, being the most beautiful.</p>

<p>
The springs, bathing establishment, and hotel known as
the Termas de Chillán are at the highest limit of the tree
line. They are owned by the municipality of Chillán, and
at the present time are leased to a Basque, Monsieur
Bernard Paguéguy, the French consul at Chillán, for the
sum of $12,240 for the season of four months, which is at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327'>[327]</a></span>
the rate of $3060 a month. In order to make a profit
Paguéguy runs a gambling establishment in conjunction
with the hostelry. People are not desired as guests who
have no lust for the green baize. Baccarat, petits chevaux,
and slot machines operate at full swing regardless of
the strict anti-gambling laws of the country. A policeman
recently lost $204, his whole worldly possessions, and
had to borrow $17.50 to get away. While I was at Las
Termas a man dropped $2040 in one evening which though
not much to lose at either Montevideo or at Mar del
Plata is a fortune to lose in Chile.</p>

At Las Termas there is a main building and about thirty
huts called <i>casuchas</i>, where lodgers room <i>en famille</i>.
There are stables and a long barrack where the peons
live. The bathhouses are about a quarter of a mile up
the ravine.
</p>

<p>
The main building is of stone and is three stories high in

slope of the hill. Besides the dining room and the coffee
room, it has a barber shop, telegraph office, doctor's office,
and rooms for guests. To one side is the administration
office, bar, two gambling rooms, writing room, and kitchen.
The ladies congregate evenings in a well-furnished hut

<p>
The casuchas all have at least three connecting rooms
and are preferable to the main building. There has been
considerable criticism in the Chillán newspapers about the
treatment of the peons at the barrack. These poor people,
afflicted with rheumatism and other ailments, and too poor
to afford to pay the regular price for food and lodging, walk
to Las Termas or come a whole family in an ox-cart or on
mule back. They tether their animals in the woods or
turn them loose in a corral. They bring their own food
and bedclothing with them and pay eighty-five cents a
day for the privilege of shelter. Sometimes a hundred of
them are jammed nondescriptly into the dirty barrack
which serves as a dining room, kitchen, and bedroom for
dirty and diseased humanity of both sexes. Some of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329'>[329]</a></span>
these poor fellows are seen nightly sleeping hunched up on
the floor against the walls of the buildings near the kitchen
and huddled close against one another for warmth, for the
nights are apt to be frightfully cold. They are unwelcome
to the host because they do not gamble.</p>

<p>
A steep climb takes one to the bathing establishment.
These are two houses, one for a steam bath and the other
for a tub bath. The price of an ordinary bath is seventeen
cents, but there are some private tub baths where it
costs double. The waters are iron, manganese, sulphur,
mercury, and potassium, such a variety as these being
hard to find in so small a radius. Although the waters are
good for rheumatism and gastric troubles they are supposed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330'>[330]</a></span>
to cure syphilis as effectively as salvarsan. Many
guests were here for this last-named ailment, although
they showed no visible outward signs. An acquaintance,
a doctor from Rancagua, was constantly urging me to take
a mineral bath, which I refused at first to do as I thought
it best to let well enough alone. By mountain climbing
I soon got so dirty that I was obliged to indulge in one for
the sake of cleanliness. As I passed with a towel over my
arm by the tennis court where a match was in progress in
front of a crowd of lady spectators, the doctor saw me.
With a roar that temporarily stopped the game and which
made me the cynosure of all eyes, he bellowed:</p>

<p>
"Ha! Ha! Stephens is going to take a bath, although
he advises against it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, doctor," I answered, "I am taking a bath for
cleanliness sake. Fortunately I am not afflicted with&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Syphilis," roared the doctor, cutting me short, which
brought screams of mirth from the spectators, more than
half of whom were ladies. I was going to terminate my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331'>[331]</a></span>
sentence with "any malady" but the doctor did not give
me time.

</div>

<p>
On the mountain above the bathhouses are some mud
volcanoes and steam spouts named fumiroles, but they
cannot compare with those of the Yellowstone.
</p>

<p>
On the day of my arrival, I had not been more than ten
minutes at the hotel when an Englishman and a Frenchman
approached me and said that they intended making
the ascent of the volcano Chillán the next day, and having
heard that Gumprecht and I intended doing the same
thing thought that it would be best to arrange a party as
there was but one guide at the establishment. I said that
I would decide later on and let them know. I did not
relish the appearance of the Frenchman, who had a tough
face, and would have preferred to make the ascent without
his company, so I went to Monsieur Paguéguy, the
lessee and administrator, and asked him if there were
more guides than one. He told me that there were several.
This settled the question, for I would not be obliged then to
make the ascent in company with the "butters in."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you not wish to go with the two gentlemen?"
inquired Paguéguy.
</p>

<p>
"I am not accustomed to forming acquaintances with
strangers who force themselves upon me," I answered.
"Moreover that Frenchman has a bad look. He looks
as if he would kill a man for a five-peso (87½ c.) note."
</p>

<p>
"Sacré! Sacré!" yelled Paguéguy, "he is my brother.
Sacré! Sacré!"
</p>

<p>
The administrator raved around like a madman. I
told him that it made no difference whether it was his
brother or not, and that the proper thing for him to have
done would have been for him to have introduced himself
in the first place; that the Termas had a bad reputation
for being a rendezvous for card sharps, and that since his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_332' name='Page_332'>[332]</a></span>
brother had the appearance of one, how was I to know the
difference?
</p>

<p>
Paguéguy told his brother and the Englishman about it.
They caught me alone that evening and tried to pick a
quarrel with me. The odds were against me for the
Englishman was much larger than I, and the Frenchman
was also a strong, powerfully built man. The loud altercation
attracted the attention of Gumprecht and a Barcelona
friend of mine named Florencio Prat, who both came
running up. The tables were now turned in my favor, so
my two antagonists prudently walked away.
</p>

<p>
"I think they mean to make trouble; let's follow them
and hear what they say?" suggested Prat.
</p>

<p>
The duo walked to a casucha and after entering it closed
the door. We three walked around the building and
getting below an open window did some necessary eavesdropping.
It was well that we did so for we heard them
planning to catch one of us alone and give the prospective
victim a beating up. It was now time to show our teeth,
which we did. Without knocking we entered the casucha
much to the astonishment of the duo and told them that if
they tried any funny business we would shoot them like
dogs regardless of the consequences, and for them to mind
their own business as we intended minding ours, otherwise
something would happen. We also showed them our
revolvers. Nothing more developed.</p>

</div>

<p>
When Gumprecht, Prat, and myself left early the next
morning to make the ascent of the volcano Chillán we
took as a guide a native named Savedra. The hotel
servants lied to us, telling us that there was no water to be
had en route and that we had better take along plenty of
liquid refreshments. This is their old trick of trying to sell
a lot of beer and whiskey. When Gumprecht told the
head-waiter to put in two drinks of whiskey for himself,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_333' name='Page_333'>[333]</a></span>
the knight of the apron put in twelve. I saw it and did not
like the idea for I thought that Gumprecht really had
ordered twelve shots of whiskey and was going to go on a
drunk on top of the volcano, which could cause a mishap.
As neither Prat nor myself drink whiskey and since I would
not permit Savedra to drink any, I was horrified at Gumprecht,
for the amount of spiritus frumenti exceeded a
quart. I approached him and said:</p>

<p>
"What in hell are you going to drink those twelve shots
of whiskey for? I think it's a bad scheme."
</p>

<p>
"I only ordered two drinks," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"The waiter put in twelve."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible."
</p>

<p>
"It's the truth," I replied.
</p>

<p>
A search of Savedra's saddlebag testified to my statement.
The head-waiter was brought.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you ordered twelve drinks," he said. Spanish
for twelve is "<i>doce</i>" and for two is "<i>dos</i>," the pronunciation
being near enough for a man to misunderstand
purposely. The head-waiter did this trick.

<p>
We left the hotel on horseback and for the first few
kilometers it was the steepest climb that I have ever made
on the back of an animal. The narrow path zigzagged up
the nose of a mountain, exceedingly dangerous, and as my
beast had an English saddle, I several times slid off onto
his rump while making the ascent. I did not know that it
was possible for horses to climb like that, and I thought
that I had previously been in very steep places in
California.</p>

<p class='caption'>Glacier Covered with Fresh Snow on the Volcano</p>
</div>

<p>
After riding some distance we came to a small glacier,
and dismounted to cross a creek at its mouth. The
horses were panting, puffing, and sweating but when we
came to the creek Savedra let them drink all they wanted
of the cold ice water. This astonished me, but he said
that they were used to it. This glacier was cavernous for
the stream flowed out of a hole at its mouth. Soon another
glacier was reached, this one fairly long, which we crossed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336'>[336]</a></span>
and then came out upon a lava field. We had to dismount
before coming to the lava field and feel our way, for some
fresh snow had fallen on the glacier, which was in some
places up to the horses' bellies. From the lava field we got
our first good view of the volcano summit. It was several
miles off in front of us up a direct steep ascent over glaciers,
snow fields, lava, and ashes. It was in eruption and
was making a terrible noise. A great column of white
smoke rose to half a kilometer high until the air currents
caused it to be borne horizontally away in white cloud
patches. I was frightened and expressed my thoughts
that we were near enough to the crater.
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing," said Savedra.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid of nothing," said Prat.
</p>

<p>
A league-wide glacier stretched in front of us; we crossed
it, keeping near the edge of some lava fields. Three long
crevasses crossed the glacier, one of which was dangerous
so we dismounted and jumped it, holding the horses by the
bridle to let them jump it. Prat's horse was the only
animal that jumped it without either falling with its fore
feet or hind feet into it. My beast fared the worst and I
thought that it was a "goner." The crevasse seemed bottomless
and to extend to infinity. The glare of the sun on
the fresh snow was terrific and caused us all to have sore eyes
which lasted several days not to mention that our faces
were burned so much that the skin peeled off. The sky
appeared to be indigo instead of azure. Since leaving the
lava fields there had been several volcanic eruptions of
five minutes' duration, each one louder as we approached.
I had now become used to them and was no longer afraid.</p>

<p>
Looking in any direction the scene was enough to imbue
any mortal with a wholesome fear of God. Grand is not
the word for the description; it was superlatively wild,
lonesome, and awful. It is nearly impossible to realize
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337'>[337]</a></span>
the terrible loneliness and awesomeness of the great peaks
of the Andes, uninhabited by man or beast or bird which
mark the boundary between Central Chile and Northern
Patagonia, their great snow-clad serrated or conical
summits towering thousands of feet into the cloudless
ether. The terrible view makes a man feel his insignificance.
I have been to the top of Misti, Ararat, and
Mont Blanc, the first mentioned two having an altitude
double that of Chillán, but from their summits the view is
incomparable with that seen from the mountain on whose
slopes I now was. To the southeast probably fifty miles
as a crow flies rose the conical snow-capped extinct volcano
of San José, and beyond it the precipitous anvil top of
twenty thousand feet high Quemazones (Burnt Places)
inaccessible, both lying in Argentina.
</p>

<p>
Early that morning a certain Carlos Michaelis from
Punta Arenas had left the Termas on foot for the summit
of the volcano, so after we had gazed with astonishment
upon the awe inspiring works of Nature just described, we
turned our attention to the higher slopes of Chillán to see
if we could see him, for up to now we had seen no sign of
him. We finally saw a black spot high up on a snow-field
which with binoculars proved to be a man. He was plodding
upward through the thick snow laboriously, and at
every few steps he would stop.
</p>

<p>
The glacier now became so steep that the slightest
stumble of one of the horses could have easily sent us rolling
hundreds of feet down its icy slopes to eternity. We had
to dismount twice again and feel our way on account of the
deep snow before we reached the final lava field where
equestrian ambulation had to cease.</p>

<p class='caption'>Savedra, Gumprecht, and Prat on Lava Fields of Volcano Chillán</p>
</div>

<p>
Arrived at the end of the trail, a kilometer below the
crater, a whistling noise accompanied by steam rose again
from the summit; then there came sounds as of a mighty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339'>[339]</a></span>
priming followed by a fierce eruption which threw rocks
as big as bath tubs in all directions. Fortunately they
did not go far, but their bombardment was enough to scare
Prat who was "afraid of nothing" and also Savedra who
had previously said "It is nothing." These two men
brave at a distance now refused to go on, so Gumprecht
and I alone started on the ascent with difficulty, picking
our way among the multitude of rocks and shoe high ashes.
Finally tired we sat on a bowlder and waited for Michaelis
whom we could see a short distance below us. When he
came up, throwing his weight on his alpenstock, we ascended
to the crater.
</p>

<p>
It happens that this crater has changed three times
during the past year, and that the present explosions do not
rise from the crater, but from some holes and fissures of
rocks that form the north wall and which are above it.
A new crater is forming here, and although considerable
smoke issues from the regular one, the danger lies higher
up. At any time there is liable to be a violent eruption
and the whole north wall will then be torn asunder.
</p>

<p>
The crater is about an eighth of a mile across with
precipitous sides. I could not see its bottom on account
of the vapors, but the ledges of its interior were piled high
with rocks. Michaelis planted some trigonometrical instruments
to take observations here, while Gumprecht
and I tried to climb the north wall. We could now see
the country to the north. The high volcanos Yeguas,
Descabezado, and Peteroa were visible in the blue distance
while near at hand the detached white peak of the Nevado
de Chillán, so called from its crown of perpetual snow,
higher than the volcano soared its lofty dome into the
heavens. This is the peak that is seen from the floor of the
Central Valley and from that distance it appears as if the
smoke were issuing from it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' name='Page_341'>[341]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As Gumprecht and I neared the apex, he was overcome
by sulphur fumes which issued from holes all about us, and
was obliged to lie down. I tried the ascent alone, and it
took me nearly twenty minutes to climb twenty meters,
an average of approximately six feet to the minute. This
slowness was due to the slippery dampness of the ground
which was here covered with a greenish mold caused by
its constant wetting by the steam. This ground was so
hot that it was nearly impossible to touch it with the hands
and the intensity of the heat soon made itself felt through
the soles of my shoes. I was obliged to crawl from rock to
rock. Eventually I arrived at a sort of natural platform
where some previous explorers had placed a few rocks
denoting the limit of safety. This place was about eight
yards from the rock pile from which the explosions took
place. The whole ground was soft. The explorers might
just as well have placed their small stone pile half a mile
down the mountain side because it is dangerous anywhere
near the summit. A few years ago some people were
badly hurt on account of flying rocks.
</p>

<p>
There had been no explosion for several minutes, so
thinking I was safe I sat down to rest. Suddenly without
the slightest warning, and with the most horrible roar that
I have ever heard, like a mighty geyser, the sulphur fumes
shot upwards followed by a gush of fire combined with a
pelting of large stones which shot out of a large hole with
the impetus of a catapult. The air sang with inflammable
material which sizzled as it struck the wet rocks. I
tried to run, but fell and slid on my bottom ripping off
the seat of my trousers. A rock hit me on my right foot
which, although I did not feel much pain from it at the
time, later on developed into an ailment which several
times during the two following years kept me confined in
bed for at least three weeks each time. In less than a few
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342'>[342]</a></span>
seconds I covered the distance to where Gumprecht was
lying. I yelled to him to hurry down the mountain to
save himself.
</p>

<p>
"Vait a minute," he yelled, "I can't breath this Gott
damn schmoke."
</p>

<p>
When he got up we hurried down the mountain in quick
time, stopping at the old crater where Michaelis was taking
observations. That man did not return with us, but waited
two hours until the explosions stopped; he then ascended
to the stone pile, but no sooner had he arrived there than
an explosion took place followed by such a pelting that he
had to remain until dark behind some cliffs, waiting for the
violence to diminish.
</p>

<p>
When we had descended to where the horses were, Prat
and Savedra rejoiced upon seeing us return alive, for they
had a fright on seeing me do the slide, and later both
Gumprecht and I running, thinking that we were done for.
This did not prevent Savedra from drinking Gumprecht's
whiskey after we had left them to make the ascent.
We chided them for their cowardice in not coming any
farther.
</p>

<p>
"I am too young to die," was Prat's excuse. Savedra
said nothing; he evidently could see no reason why he
should undergo strenuous exercise besides running the risk
of getting blown up, when he could see the explosions from
where he was. It was hot when we had left Las Termas
in the morning and I wore a summer suit of clothes and a
straw hat. Near the summit of the volcano in snowy
defiles where the sun never reaches it was around the zero
mark which I keenly felt if I stood still a minute. When
we arrived back at the hotel, the crowd gathered around us
and asked us all about the trip. The Englishman and the
Frenchman with whom we had quarreled started out the
next day to make the ascent, but overcome with a "streak
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343'>[343]</a></span>
of yellow" went only as far as the end of the glacier.
Their game was ping-pong.</p>

<p class='caption'>Mountain Scenery and Waterfall at Las Trancas</p>
</div>

<p>
When we finally left Las Termas we walked to Resinto,
a distance of twenty miles, and drove to La Dehesa stopping
en route a few minutes at the post house of La Quila
to change horses. The road is rocky and is bordered by
blackberry bushes whose vines grow to a prodigious size.
The Chilean blackberry, named <i>sarsamorra</i>, is different
from our wild blackberry in the fact that it is sweeter, has
a milder flavor and in shape is wider, shorter, and rounder.
When I made this trip, the bushes were bent down with
the weight of this succulent fruit which was now ripe.
The sarsamorra is a pest in Chile, as it springs up everywhere,
and spreading over the fields is hard to stamp out.
It forms natural hedges for estate boundaries and field
limits.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_344' name='Page_344'>[344]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In all this Ñuble country overcoats and thick underwear
come in handy. The nights are cool in summer while in
winter there is snow in the hills. I saw people in the plaza
in Chillán in March, which corresponds to September in
countries north of the Tropic of Cancer, wearing overcoats.
Not that it was really cold enough to wear them,
but it is a fad with South Americans to don overcoats upon
the slightest occasion.
</p>

<p>
I was obliged to stop a day at the Hotel Central on my
return to Chillán owing to the failure of the administration
of the Termas to telephone to Monsieur Heguy reserving
me a room at the Hotel de France. The Central is not
bad, but it seems to have no proper management; it is a
costly establishment but is not as clean as the Hotel de
France. As the hotel was filled, I was obliged to sleep in a
sample room. Because I presented an uncouth appearance
upon my arrival, due to a week's "roughing it," the
obsequious boy who acts as head push, hotel runner, etc.,
thought that I was a bum and intended giving me a cot in
a room with a couple of "drunks" on the top floor, to
which I made serious objections. At the Central the
better a person is dressed upon arrival, the better a room
he gets. The size of a piece of meat served in the dining-room
is equal to that of a walnut.
</p>

<p>
At Pinto I met Don Vicente Mendez U, governor of the
Province of Ñuble. He was returning from a tour of
inspection of the farmers' mutual railway. He was very
much interested in North American customs which he
wanted to see introduced in Chile especially in his province,
chiefly the prohibition propaganda of which he
had read much. He thought that it would be a good
thing to have the Province of Ñuble go dry and advocated
it strongly. Later on in conversation with him
when I told him that I was in Chile to look the country
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_345' name='Page_345'>[345]</a></span>
over in view of starting up a new industry, stating that I
thought that a brewery would pay in Chillán, he changed
his views and said that it would be quite the thing because
the Julius Jenson brewery did not do a big enough business
to satisfy the wants of the inhabitants, and that the inhabitants
of the city had to import beer from Valdivia and
Talca. He made an appointment to meet me the next
day and brought with him the mayor of the city and some
of the important officials. There was proposed to me
that if I would build a brewery in Chillán, I should receive
as a concession a track of land on the railroad besides an
exemption from taxes for a number of years. They were
very enthusiastic about the proposition. The governor
also said that it would pay in Chillán to found a hypothecary
agricultural bank. I doubt the feasibility of this
because crops often go to waste on account of no market.
My friend the doctor from Rancagua grew twenty thousand
bushels of barley in 1916; of this he was only able to
dispose of one carload.
</p>

<p>
In 1916 there was a great railroad strike on the State
Railroads of Chile; owing to it trains were invariably late
and did not run nights. I was therefore obliged to stop
off overnight at Curicó en route to Santiago. At the
stations of San Carlos and Villa Alegre there were enough
watermelons, here called <i>sandias</i>, piled up to supply
the entire republic. There are no freight sheds at the
stations large enough to store the crops about to be exported,
so it is not uncommon for a farmer to have his
whole grain crop spoiled by rain as it lies in sacks near the
platforms.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Curicó at night and stopped at the Hotel
Curicó, which is run in connection with the eating-house
at the depot. It is a large brick old-fashioned building.
The daughter of the landlady is one of the most attractive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346'>[346]</a></span>
girls I have ever had the fortune of meeting, and in the
two days that I was there I had a feeling for her that can
be described as infatuation. She was rather tall and
slender but well built, a brunette, and about twenty-two
years old. She was also refined and possessed good sense.
I did not try to become well acquainted with her as I had
no desire to play with fire, but these attractions of hers I
was able to perceive without intimate acquaintanceship.
</p>

<p>
Curicó is the capital of the province of the same name.
This province and that of Talca are the two poorest in
Central Chile in agriculture, although the land is fertile
and in some parts is highly cultivated. The city lies in the
center of the Central Valley and owing to its geographical
situation it has become quite a busy town. Its population
in 1917 was 22,452 inhabitants against 17,573 in 1907. It
is the twelfth city of Chile. Curicó has far better government,
public and private buildings than Chillán, and its
main streets teem with life. The streets are narrow and
are paved with small sharp stones. The Calle Prat is
the street that leads to the railroad station and is one of
the main ones. Four blocks east of the station it is intersected
by another main street which runs north and south.
Following this street south one arrives at a beautiful plaza,
on which is the severe but stately Capitol and several other
large buildings which are of the Georgian type of architecture.
Besides the Hotel Curicó, there are six or seven
other hotels, the Central, the Comercio, etc. Of these
the Central is the best. It has two patios above one of
which is a grape trellis from which, when I saw it, dangled
bunches of fruit, blue, red, and green.

CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="s08">NORTHWARD TO ANTOFAGASTA BY RAIL. COPIAPÓ, ANTOFAGASTA,
AND IQUIQUE</span>
</h2>

<p>
I remained a couple of months in Santiago after returning
from Chillán which I put in profitably by making
excursions and foot tours to the nearby mountain canyons,
visiting the small towns in the neighborhood and studying
the business possibilities of the future as applied to the
Chilean capital.
</p>

<p>
One night as I sat having my shoes shined in a bootblack
stand underneath the Portal Fernans on the south side of
the Plaza de Armas, I noticed passing by an Englishman
named Greenberg, an old acquaintance whom I last saw
in Arequipa, Peru, in 1913. Greenberg was a salesman
for the Browning Arms Company, originally hailing from
Liverpool but had been quite a few years on the West
Coast. In Arequipa we were introduced to a wealthy
family named Larramendi and were frequent guests at
their house. They had three charming daughters. One
night while Greenberg and I were calling on the Larramendi
girls, I overheard him proposing marriage to the
oldest one, Felipa. I was considerably annoyed at this
because Greenberg had already a wife and children in the
old country. I upbraided him for his actions but was
surprised when he answered me that he was sincere in his
proposal and that since he and his wife did not get along
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348'>[348]</a></span>
very well together, he intended marrying Felipa and
settling down in Arequipa. I knew that sooner or later
he would be found out and as I did not care to be a witness
of such an act towards a family that had shown me so
much consideration, I quietly left Arequipa saying nothing
to Greenberg about my departure.</p>

<p class='caption'>Church in San Felipe</p>
</div>

<p>
Now after an elapse of three years without having heard
anything about the outcome, curiosity got the best of me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349'>[349]</a></span>
so I hailed Greenberg. I invited him to a quiet café and
heard his story.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i374" id="i374"></a>
<img src="images/i-374.jpg" width="378" height="500" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>City Hall, San Felipe</p>
</div>

<p>
Greenberg married Felipa and shortly after the marriage,
old Larramendi sent him with his bride to live on an
upland estancia about fifty miles east of Arequipa in the
high Andes, which estancia Greenberg became the manager
of. He had lived there for two years rarely coming
to Arequipa and had become the father of a child by this
new union. He made considerable money for his father-in-law,
who in turn gave him no salary nor wages, and this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350'>[350]</a></span>
latter fact coupled with the life of ennui that he was leading
caused him to have a talk with the old man about his
future. He demanded a salary but this Larramendi
refused to give him saying that he himself was an old man
and would not live for more than fifteen years more, and
that when he died Greenberg would inherit the bulk of his
fortune on account of his business ability, so what more
could he ask for?
</p>

<p>
Greenberg than told Larramendi that if a change did
not immediately forthcome, he would quit the managership
of the estancia and would leave there with his wife
to resume his old calling of salesman which paid him well.
</p>

<p>
"If you do," said Larramendi, "I shall have you
arrested for bigamy."
</p>

<p>
"What is that you said?" yelled Greenberg, scarcely
believing his own ears.
</p>

<p>
Larramendi then went on and told him that he had
carefully looked him up before inviting him to his house
and had found out that he was married and had a wife and
children in Liverpool whose address he had. He said
that he did not care a rap for that part of the business for
he wanted to see his daughters married to Anglo-Saxon
stock. "It will improve the race," he said, "especially
that of my own immediate family." He told Greenberg
that for this reason and also for the fact that he knew him
to be a good business man he had urged the marriage and
was willing to keep his mouth shut provided Greenberg
would keep on living as he had the past two years, but
that if he attempted to run away he would have him
arrested for bigamy. Greenberg returned home to the
bleak mountain estancia and confessed the whole thing to
Felipa. She stood by him and both thought out a scheme
to get away. A year afterwards their plan matured
when Larramendi was on a business trip to Lima. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_351' name='Page_351'>[351]</a></span>
went to Bolivia and thence to Chile where Greenberg
obtained a position as manager of a mercantile house in
Valparaiso. Fortunately for him, his first wife not having
heard from him in over three years had divorced him on
grounds of desertion and had married another man.
Greenberg communicated this news by letter to Larramendi
who was now inducing him by offers of a most lucrative
salary to return to Arequipa. This Greenberg had
so far refused to consider because he did not know what
new trick Larramendi had in store for him.
</p>

<p>
"You were lucky, Stephens," he said, "to have left
Arequipa when you did. Larramendi was planning to
catch you for his youngest daughter, and likewise had you
looked up. He thought you would have made a good
match for her and has many times deplored that you went
away. He was very fond of you and I honestly believe
Anastasia loved you and still hopes you will return. However
if you married her, you would be in the same mess
that I was in. Larramendi is not so old as he likes to
make out and I doubt if he will cash in his checks for
twenty-five years yet. That is a long time waiting for
dead men's shoes. I am satisfied where I am and when I
reached Chile I knew that I was safe for even if my first
wife hadn't obtained a divorce the Peruvian extradition
laws are a joke and the Chilean government would never
have given me up to be sent back to Peru to stand trial for
bigamy there."</p>

<p>
The time was approaching when I had to return to the
United States; Prat was just as anxious to return to
Barcelona, and Gumprecht was getting restless in Santiago
and wanted to see more of Chile, especially the northern
part. We accordingly made arrangements to go north by
rail taking our time to the trip stopping off at different
places. Prat and I had a great impedimenta of baggage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_352' name='Page_352'>[352]</a></span>
constituting curiosities that we had collected on our travels
besides live parrots, toads, turtles, etc. indigenous to
South America not to mention a couple of trunks full of
bulbs and seeds which I intended to experiment with by
planting at home. We also had baskets, pottery, and
Indian blankets. We did not care to be encumbered with
them and as we met a roustabout in Santiago who was
recommended to us for his honesty, and who was anxious
to get to Lima to accept a position that was offered him
there, but could not make the grade through lack of funds,
we told him we would pay his passage to that port if he
would take our baggage with him. This proposition he
jumped at so we made arrangements for him to sail on a
boat that was to leave Valparaiso the following month.
That would make him reach Lima about the same time
Prat and I would arrive. This roustabout's name was
Angel Larrain. He was a tough looking customer about
thirty-eight years old, was broad shouldered, and wore a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353'>[353]</a></span>
full beard which he seldom kept trimmed. His facial
appearance was adorned by an ugly scar on his right temple
which he received in a saloon brawl some years previously
in one of Valparaiso's waterfront dives.
</p>

<p>
Not far out of our route northward are the Springs of
Jahuel which are so well known that we determined to
take them in. To reach them it is first necessary to take
the train to San Felipe, three hours distant from either Santiago
or Valparaiso, and then drive twelve and a half miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i378" id="i378"></a>
<img src="images/i-378.jpg" width="542" height="261" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Street in Almendraz</p>
</div>

<p>
San Felipe, with a population of 14,426 inhabitants, is
the capital and largest city of the Province of Aconcagua
which lies directly north of the Province of Santiago.
This large province is Andine in character although it
extends to the ocean and in its confines are the highest
mountains in Chile. It is semi-arid although in its narrow
valleys the largest vineyards in the republic are
located. It is famous for its wines and its chicha. This
last is a sort of grape cider, muddy brown in color, sweet
and heavy and is apt to give the partaker indigestion. It
should not be confused with the chicha of Peru. Peruvian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354'>[354]</a></span>
chicha is an alcoholic beverage made from cereals and is
akin to moonshine or corn whiskey.
</p>

<p>
San Felipe is a dull, old-fashioned town with a good
hotel, the Europa. A couple of hours is sufficient to see
all the attractions of the city unless the visitor is religiously
bent for the city boasts of several large churches. The
original city was square, its sides being about three-quarters
of a mile long and was bounded by an alameda with a
double drive on each side of a pedestrian promenade in
the center. The trees between the roads and the walk are
giant elms and maples. The city has outgrown its original
boundary and extends some distance on the outward sides
of the alameda; this growth has not been recent as can be
testified by the crumbling appearance of the houses which
are of adobe and have a height of but a single story. The
appearance of the place is that of stagnation; a small brewery
is the only manufacturing interest but like that of
Julius Jenson in Chillán, its product does not meet the
wants of the local trade.
</p>

<p>
The plaza is lovely and cool which is a great contrast to
the alameda where the dust is insupportable. In it are
statues of mythological goddesses which are of Carrara
marble. In its center is a fountain surrounded by a large
round pool while in the plots of earth grows a profusion of
calla lilies. There are also some fine palms and a great
trumpet vine. Situated on the plaza is a big church.
It is adobe and has a frame top and steeple. It is painted
pink, and on its façade cracks caused by an earthquake are
in evidence. The interior is poor and on its walls hang
cheap paintings. When any prominent citizen dies a
marble slab is mounted in the church for his memory.
At the eastern end of the city is a papier maché imitation
Grotto of Lourdes, the alms box at its gates being the most
visible of its sights.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355'>[355]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The drive to Jahuel is devoid of interest. For a couple
of miles the road runs eastward along a turnpike bordered
by mud walls so high that it is impossible to see over them.
The dust is terrible. Soon the village of Almendraz is
reached with its narrow streets, ancient yellow church
with a clock tower surmounted by a dome, and a Calvary
on a high rock at the end of the main street. The turnpike
has swung to the north and continues in this direction
all the way to Jahuel. A large village named Santa
Marta is traversed and the dry bed of a river is followed.
Although there are plenty of small farms and the land is
thickly settled, it is nevertheless a much poorer country
than in the Central Valley. The mountains are devoid
of all vegetation excepting a few sage bushes here and
there. In the valley cactuses are abundant, but everything
has a dry, parched look.
</p>

<p>
Jahuel, which is the name given to the hotel, bathing
establishment, and water is the property of Delano and
Weinstein of Valparaiso. The place is sadly overrated.
The hotel building is good and modern although the food
at the meals is scarcely enough for a mouse; the rooms are
small and plain, but clean. I remarked about the scantiness
of the meals to the manager. "We can't have such
luxuries as chicken every meal," he replied. "Nobody
said anything about chicken," I retaliated; "anyhow who
considers that a luxury in Chile when it is the commonest
of meat? What I was kicking about is why you don't
serve a square meal." A splendid vista of the Aconcagua
Valley at one's feet can be had from the terrace and the
verandas.
</p>

<p>
The altitude of Jahuel is 3835 feet above sea level, but
strange to say the nights are not cool. The water comes
from the near by Los Pajaritos Springs and its bottled
carbonated adulteration is shipped all over Chile. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356'>[356]</a></span>
is a swimming tank and a sun bath at the establishment.
A South American sun bath is a boarded-in yard with
some wooden benches on which people recline in the Garden
of Eden garb. A partition divides the sun bath into
spaces for both sexes, the men being on one side of the wall
and the women on the other. Some young Actæons had
placed a ladder against the partition on the men's side at
Jahuel in order to gaze upon the contours of female figures
on the women's side.</p>

<img src="images/i-381.jpg" width="538" height="314" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Jahuel</p>
</div>

<p>
At the present time there is nothing to see at Jahuel.
In ten years' time it may develop into a lovely park. The
trees are too young yet to afford shade. The lawn and
flower beds are well arranged but they are now in the
transition stage between a desert and a garden spot.
Many of the famous California health and society spots
to which thousands of tourists make their invernal hegira
were worse twenty years ago than Jahuel is to-day. The
establishment savors of Teutonic cliques. The majority
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_357' name='Page_357'>[357]</a></span>
of guests are of German extraction and pair off into groups.
Some of the maidens that nightly promenade the terrace
are such past mistresses in the art of cigarette smoking
that their bodies and clothes reek with the odor of nicotine.
This does not appear to have the effect of depreciating
their charms for on several occasions in the <i>bosque</i>
I inadvertently caught amorous swains clandestinely exchanging
kisses with these foul-breathed virgins.
</p>

<p>
One of the great advertised sights is the bosque. The
word bosque means jungle of small trees. Trees are so
scarce in that part of the country that when there is a
similacrum of one it becomes famous and is advertised.
This bosque is no better than a brush heap but it attracts
visitors by a well-kept trail and painted signs. It is distant
from the hotel by a seven and a half minutes' walk;
nonagenarians walk it in fifteen minutes. The signs,
therefore, read "To the Bosque of Quillayé, 15 minutes."
Nonagenarians leave more money at Jahuel than young
people because the former are so old that they spend at
least two weeks there, while the latter, driven to distraction
by ennui rarely remain more than a day, unless to
enjoy the attractions of the cigarette-smoking German
maidens.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to make the trip from Santiago to Pisagua,
one of the northernmost ports of Chile by rail. Through
trains run only as far as Iquique. It takes four days this
way from Santiago to Iquique which includes a stop of
one and a half hours at Illapel, a half hour's stop at La
Serena, two and a half hours at Vallenar, one and a half
hours at Copiapó, nine hours at Catalina, and four hours
at Baquedano. Nineteen and a half hours are wasted
at these stations yet the travel consumes less time than
that by ocean steamer from Valparaiso to Iquique. I
think that I am the first North American not officially
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358'>[358]</a></span>
connected with the railroad that made the trip as far as
Antofagasta. The through train runs every Friday, and
after the first day out the journey is most tedious and enervating,
hot and dusty with vistas of the most desolate
desert imaginable. I broke the journey at Copiapó,
continuing thence by local trains.
</p>

<p>
The Northern Longitudinal Railway begins at the town
of La Calera which is on the Santiago-Valparaiso Railroad.
As far as Copiapó it is a narrow gauge but after leaving
that town it has three rails for some distance in order to
carry both broad gauge and narrow gauge traffic. The
original railroads of Chile which ran from the interior to
the coast towns were all broad gauge and as it is cheaper
to lay another rail inside the already existing two rails
to accommodate narrow gauge traffic than to lay a new
roadbed this triple rail phenomenon is met with in many
places in Northern Chile. The train composed of two
sleepers and other coaches leaves La Calera upon the
arrival of the Santiago-Valparaiso express. To reach La
Calera from San Felipe I was obliged to change cars at
Llai-Llai midway between Santiago and Valparaiso. The
first day's ride is interesting, although the country is
sparsely populated and semi-arid. It is a continuous
slowly winding up the canyons, passing through tunnels
at the Coast Range summits, and a mad race around
curves down other canyons. The first summit is reached
an hour after leaving La Calera; the train goes through a
tunnel under the pass of Palos Quemados and enters the
Valley of La Ligua. This is followed upward to Cabildo
where the river is crossed. Then by means of sharp
zigzags another summit is reached and we descend into
the fertile but narrow Valley of Petorca. The small city
of Petorca lies about fifteen miles up the river of the same
name beyond where we turn up the Estero de las Palmas
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359'>[359]</a></span>
(Palm Creek). This brook gets its name from the great
abundance of palms which grow wild all over the sides of
the mountains at its source. There are several of these
palmares in Chile, which are botanical freaks for this
particular mountain specie is found in their natural state
nowhere else in South America. The largest of these palmares
is that of Ocoa near La Calera; another one is at
Concon, at the mouth of the Aconcagua River. They
are valuable for their honey. A hole is drilled into the tree
near its base, a tube is inserted and the sap is extracted
which is made into honey.</p>

<img src="images/i-384.jpg" width="540" height="380" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Ocoa</p>
</div>

<p>
Across the mountains north of the Estero de las Palmas
is the mournful desolate mountain pocket of Tilama, the
headwaters of the Quilimari River. The Indians hereabouts
weave rugs, blankets, and table-cloths of a fine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_360' name='Page_360'>[360]</a></span>
durable texture which are in great demand. They are
red with white flower designs. The Tilama ridge is
crossed and finally two more, one to the Pupio River and
one to the Choapa River before darkness sets in.
</p>

<p>
The Choapa is a fertile valley and the river of the same
name forms the boundary line between the provinces of
Aconcagua and Choapa. The Province of Choapa was
created by an Act of Congress in December 1915, and to
define it a large area of land was taken from the southern
part of the Province of Coquimbo. Up to the time of
this writing (1918) the limits of its various departments
have not been defined. Illapel, the new capital, on a
river of the same name was reached about 8 <span class='s08'>P.M.</span> It has
a population of about five thousand inhabitants and is
filled with life owing to its sudden acquisition of importance.
Salamanca and Combarbalá are the only other
towns worthy of mention in the new province. Los Vilos
in the Province of Aconcagua is the seaport of Illapel with
which it is connected by railroad. I took a walk up the
main street of Illapel. It is an old-fashioned town, very
long and narrow. Its houses, mostly one story in height,
are painted white. The streets were crowded and a band
was playing.
</p>

<p>
I awoke the next morning at Ovalle, a growing stock
town in the southern part of the Province of Coquimbo.
It had by the census of 1907, 6998 inhabitants but I understand
that it has increased considerably in population since
then. It lies on the Limari River just below the junctions
of the Grande and the Hurtado rivers which uniting form
the Limari. For its port it has Tongoi on the bay of the
same name to which place it is connected by rail, but now
much of the freight goes to Coquimbo. At Coquimbo,
which was reached a couple of hours later, I obtained my
first unhindered view of the Pacific Ocean on this South
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' name='Page_361'>[361]</a></span>
American trip. From Ancud on the Island of Chiloé,
I could look across the great expanse of bay to the headlands
which formed the promontories beyond which the
ocean was, but owing to the rain the ocean proper there was
invisible. Coquimbo is a busy and dirty port of 12,106
inhabitants and has no attractions such as possesses the
eight miles distant city of La Serena, the capital of the
Province of Coquimbo.
</p>

<p>
La Serena is named in honor of the last viceroy of Peru.
His name means serene. The city is also serene. It is
one of the oldest towns in Chile, has 15,966 inhabitants
and is admirably situated on a height of land overlooking
the Pacific Ocean to the west and the Elqui River to the
north. It is a quiet town of handsome buildings and is the
residence of many retired men of wealth and of intellectuals.
In this respect it can be compared with Paraná in
Argentina and Graz in Austria. Its population has
decreased slightly in recent years yet the city is stable and
will always remain so. Its only industry is the Floto
Brewery. To any Michiganders reading this book, I
wish to call attention to the fact that it was visited in
1906 by Hon. Chase S. Osborn. The level country about
La Serena and Coquimbo and the neighboring valleys are
fertile and well-watered. Fields are given up to the cultivation
of grain and vineyards abound. A native fruit
named the pepina, akin to the papaya is grown and from it
a soft drink is made which although palatable is rather
insipid. About twenty miles south of the city among the
foothills is the mineral spring of Andacollo famed locally,
while thirty miles north of La Serena are the newly opened
iron mines of La Higuera, controlled by North American
capital.
</p>

<p>
After leaving La Serena, the all-day ride northward to
Vallenar is for the main part uninteresting although it has a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' name='Page_362'>[362]</a></span>
recompense in the wild mountain scenery when the train
winds up the canyon known as the Quebrada del Potrerillos.
At nine o'clock at night, Vallenar the second city
of the Province of Atacama was arrived at. The train was
scheduled to remain here for two and a half hours but
there was some trouble with the locomotive which kept us
here all night and part of the next morning. It happened
that a telegram had to be sent to Coquimbo for an extra
locomotive to be sent up to Vallenar.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Vallenar</p>
</div>

<p>
Vallenar is the original home of the patio process for the
extraction of silver from the ore by means of crushing.
Mercury is added forming an amalgam and the silver is
obtained by heating the amalgam, which evaporates the
mercury leaving as a residue the crude silver. It is no
longer a mining-town but is the center of the fruit growing
Huasco district. Figs of Huasco are famous. Quite a
trade is carried on by the exportation of raisins, here
named <i>tapas</i>. Vallenar has 5561 inhabitants. It is on the
Huasco River and is connected by rail with Freirina and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_363' name='Page_363'>[363]</a></span>
the seaport, Huasco. It was pleasant to again see trees.
It seldom rains in this region. When I alighted from
the train at the railroad station there was such a heavy mist
it resembled rain. It accumulated into drops where it
had fallen on the leaves and as such fell onto the sidewalks.
Near the depot is a large finca surrounded by gum and
poplar trees, and the sound of running water in the irrigation
ditches behind the high adobe walls was refreshing.
It takes thirty-five minutes to walk the length of the main
street, but the city is only six blocks wide. A half mile up
this street is a plaza with a stagnant pool in its center where
are gold fishes. A miniature Eiffel Tower whose top is
crowned by an illuminated clock that does not keep time
soars above a stand where an infantry band was playing.
When a crowd had collected to listen to the music
the band moved off up the street until it came to a
moving picture show, whose proprietor had hired it for
the evening as an advertisement. Nowhere in my travels
have I seen so many bands both military and private as
in Chile.</p>

<p>
The streets of Vallenar are narrow, and although
lighted with electricity, they are dark. The city is ancient
in appearance and as one passes by the gloomy structures
in the misty night, a feeling is present that one of the
doors leading into the adobe hovels might open and that
the pedestrian will be yanked by unknown hands inside,
where he will be robbed and murdered by disembowelment

has not the street life of Illapel, yet I must say in its favor

that never elsewhere in a town of its size have I seen so
much beauty among women.</p>

<p>
At Copiapó I stayed four days. It is the capital of the
Province of Atacama and has a population of 10,287
inhabitants although it looks considerably larger. Fifty
years ago it had fourteen thousand inhabitants. At that
time it was a mining center, and much of the wealth
among the leading families of Santiago to-day has its origin
from mines formerly located here. The railroad to the
fifty-two miles distant seaport of Caldera was opened to
traffic in 1850 and is one of the oldest in South America.
The original locomotive used is now to be seen in the
National Museum at Santiago.
</p>

<p>
The city is situated in an oasis in the desert; this oasis
is twenty-five miles long by two miles broad and is cultivated
to an amazing degree. It is traversed by the turbulent
muddy and narrow Copiapó River which furnishes
irrigation to the many <i>quintas</i>. Peaches, figs, grapes, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366'>[366]</a></span>
apricots grow in profusion as do also loquats and other
local fruits whose names are unfamiliar to me. A specie
of willow is indigenous to the valley which in form is not
unlike a Lombardy poplar and from a distance is often
mistaken for one of them.
</p>

<p>
The environs of the city have a decidedly oriental appearance
due to the high mud garden walls which shut
off from the passer-by the rich verdure of the enclosed
terrain, making the only objects visible to him the dusty
windowless backs of sheds with an occasional tree rising
above an adobe wall.</p>

<p>
Copiapó is retrogressant and will become even more
so. Work has long since stopped at the mines and the
only thing that keeps the place alive is that it is the capital
of a province. If asked for a description of the city,
I would say that it is an old adobe town in an oasis
surrounded by barren mountains, with a broad alameda
bordered with giant pepper trees. This brief description
is accurate. The pepper trees are the largest I have ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' name='Page_367'>[367]</a></span>
seen and some of them are nearly eight feet in diameter.
The alameda has an abundance of statues to Atacama
heroes with a soldiers' monument to the illustrious Atacama
dead. The house roofs rise to a slight gable and nearly
all are of adobe. This mode of construction could not be
possible in a country where rain falls frequently, because
in 1915 when there was a hard rainfall in Copiapó, the
first time that it had rained in eight years, many of the
roofs became mud puddles and were washed in.</p>

<p>
There are only two hotels in the Atacama metropolis,
the Atacama and the Ingles. I stopped at the former
which is the best. It is owned by a Boer named Bosman
who married a native woman. Since the proprietor finds
mining more profitable than hotel business, he leaves the
management of his inn in the charge of his younger son.
The hotel is fair as well as the meals, although it has none
of the modern conveniences. The primitive privy is
reached by crossing a barnyard and is a favorite place for
poultry which roost here. I discovered a tarantula on the
seat. To reach this place one has to run the gauntlet of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' name='Page_368'>[368]</a></span>
semi wild swine some of which were ugly. The Ingles is
owned by a native who is the son of a once famous Spanish
opera singer. This man thinks well of himself although
his only claim for distinction is evidenced by a disgusting
ringworm on his right cheek which is larger than a dollar.
In his emporium coarse obscene jests and loud words are
the order of the day. There are only two bars in Copiapó
and these are in each of the hotels. It is needless to say
that the proprietor of the Ingles does the most business
in that line because he consumes half of his sales. Copiapó
is a poor saloon town because the natives make their
own wine and chicha. They often repair to a section of
the oasis named the Chimba, where they roast a lamb, hog
or an ox and there amidst a copious supply of fermented
beverages indulge in an orgy that baffles description.</p>

Some of the hovels near the river bank are the extremity

would shun these shanties of mud, straw, and tin cans
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369'>[369]</a></span>

space in front of these hovels are littered with bones,

<p>
The cemetery is lugubrious, and in many a grave there
is a cavity beneath the tombstone where can be seen the
grinning skull of its occupant. It was founded in 1848 and
a motto over the entrance denotes it as a place of peace.
I cannot realize how this motto is appropriate because
visitors are constantly perturbing the bones with their
canes. The hook and ladder and fire engine date from
1868 but the Matriz or large church on the Plaza Arturo
Prat antedates it fifty years. It is a large edifice with a
square tower of New England colonial architecture. The
church of San Francisco is after the style of the French
Cathedral at New Orleans. Although the city has but a
population of slightly over ten thousand inhabitants, it
nevertheless boasts of five daily newspapers, none of
which by the way are worth reading as their columns deal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370'>[370]</a></span>
solely with local events such as a man stumbling on a toad
and spraining his ankle, etc.
</p>

<p>
Taking a walk with Gumprecht down the railroad track
we saw behind a wall a large tree laden with luscious purple
figs. We climbed upon the wall to reach some when I
noticed a girl driving some sheep across a trestle. I
called Gumprecht's attention. He was startled thinking
the owner of the quinta was coming and fell from the wall
into the garden. In falling he accidentally tripped me up
and I took a header in the opposite direction landing me
into a bush which had prickly burrs which littered my
clothing, clinging tenaciously to them. In extracting
them I got my hands full of the barbed nettles which these
burrs were composed of. As I fell I heard a yell from the
other side of the wall and upon climbing it again saw that
Gumprecht was having a lively fight with an enraged bull
dog which had bitten him a couple of times. I came to his
rescue with my revolver. In the meantime Gumprecht
had drawn his revolver and between us we made short
work with the bull dog. The shooting aroused the neighborhood
and we could see farm laborers running to the
scene with pitchforks. We took to our heels and finally
hid by lying down in a dry irrigation ditch where we
remained half an hour. When the hunt had somewhat
subsided we struck out for the town by a detour but lost
ourselves at a river which we forded. We started up a
trail between some Kaffir corn when we suddenly came to
another fig tree. When we were devouring this fruit we
were caught by the owner of this quinta which was a full
mile from the one where the bull dog was. We offered to
pay him for it, but in excellent English he told us to help
ourselves.
</p>

<p>
This man was Professor Platner, president of the Chile
College of Mines whose three-story yellow institution we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_371' name='Page_371'>[371]</a></span>
could see through the trees. He was a German, had lost a
fortune in mining, owned a fine quinta, had lived in Copiapó
for twenty-five years and was anxious to sell out and
get away on account of being tired of the place. He
showed us his quinta, gave us all the fruit we could eat, and
revealed to us much information about the mining past
and present in the province. He had installed an ore
crusher on his place which he rented to miners on the percentage
system. It was the Chilean process of gold extracting
originated at Copiapó. There were several stone
bottom tubs each holding a wheel perpendicular to the
base and which is revolved by means of a large horizontal
wheel which fits into grooves. The large wheel is set into
motion by water power from the river. The tubs are filled
with a layer of ore and the crushing begins; mercury and
water are then added. The mercury and the gold form
an amalgam which is carried off by a pipe into another tub
along with the water. After straining, the amalgam is
put into a retort which is heated at its base. The mercury
escapes through a tube and is caught in a pail of water
to be used again. Platner said that either gold or copper
was mined according to the value of copper. When copper
falls below fifty pesos a ton, gold is mined. At the
time of my visit, copper was worth 112 pesos a ton.
</p>

<p>
During the colonial times the silver mines in the neighborhood
of Copiapó were worked by the Spaniards, and it
is said that more than twenty thousand Indians were
exterminated through overwork in these mines. About
four generations ago these mines became the properties of
about a dozen individuals, most of whom lived in Santiago.
They were worked successfully until they died. The
mineral property was then divided among their heirs and
when these heirs died, there were other divisions among new
heirs. On account of these divisions work soon ceased.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' name='Page_372'>[372]</a></span>
Now in order for a man to get a clean title to any of this
mineral property all the heirs have to agree to the sale and
there are a multitude scattered all over the world which
makes getting a deed nearly impossible. There have been
instances when nearly all the heirs were found and agreed
to a sale only to have it held up at the last minute by one
or more parties backing out. A bill is before the Chilean
senate for the state to take over all mineral lands that
have not been worked for fifty years; if it passes these
mines will again be in operation.
</p>

<p>
Copiapó boasts of one millionaire. He lives in a ramshackle
salmon-colored house of stuccoed adobe which
has been cracked by an earthquake. The city is also the
birthplace of Martin Rivas, the hero of Blest-Gana's
novel <i>Martin Rivas</i> which is considered to be a classic of
Spanish literature.
</p>

<p>
From Copiapó northward the longitudinal railroad to
Iquique runs over a great arid desert winding its way
across sandy plateaus hemmed in by barren mountains.
The southern part of this desolation is named the Atacama
Desert and here on the high mountainsides are seen the
shafts and settlements of the gold and copper mines.
Dulcinea is the first large mine reached. San Pedro is
reached in the afternoon and later on Pueblo Hundido, the
junction for Chañaral, and the headquarters of the Andes
Copper Company. The next morning the train arrives at
Catalina, the junction for Taltal and now enters the
nitrate country. The same day it stops at Aguas Blancas,
the junction for Antofagasta, Chuquicamata, the newly
opened copper mining town of the Guggenheim interests,
and Bolivia. The railroad from Catalina northward goes
through the center of the nitrate country and has several
branches running down to the seaports such as that from
Toco to Tocopilla. Toco is passed in the middle of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373'>[373]</a></span>
night as well as Quillagua, the last mentioned place being
an oasis in the Desert of Tararugal. Pintados which is
reached forty-eight hours after leaving Copiapó is the
terminus of the longitudinal railway and here trains must
be changed for Iquique and Pisagua, the northernmost
nitrate port.
</p>

<p>
Although my ticket was bought for Iquique, I was
obliged to leave the train at Aguas Blancas and go direct to
Antofagasta. I had the misfortune to break a blood vessel
in my right foot in Copiapó shortly before boarding the
train, which dolorous accident was due to the injury I
received when a rock hit my foot as I was trying to escape
from the catapult of stones that were shot from the crater
of Volcano Chillán. I consider that my quickness in
reaching Antofagasta was what saved me from crossing
the River Lethe. I was flat on my back in that prosperous
seaport for three weeks.
</p>

<p>
Antofagasta, the commercial metropolis of Northern
Chile has a population of 60,297 inhabitants although it
does not look nearly so large. It is the fourth city of
Chile and has in recent years taken away much of Iquique's
trade, although the latter place does not appear to
be dull. The downtown business streets of Antofagasta
are paved with asphalt and work is now under way to pave
the whole city. Sewers have been extended and the mule
power street cars have been discarded for autobuses; a
man named Yankovich having obtained the concession
for this means of passenger traffic. The old buildings of
adobe, wood, corrugated iron, and stuccoed cane are fast
being replaced with metropolitan structures of brick and
cement. Among these new edifices can be mentioned the
city hall, the fire department, the Mercantile Bank of
Bolivia, the Victoria Theater, and Luksic's Hotel Belmont.
</p>

<p>
The city from being a pestilential port in the past is now
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374'>[374]</a></span>
scrupulously clean, although in its suburbs improvements
can be made. The municipality has waged war against
the butchers and vegetable dealers compelling them to
screen their goods from the flies. Protesting mass meetings
were of no avail. A new railroad station has been
built on the heights above the city and the old ramshackle
wooden structure which is an eyesore to the city will be
torn down to make way for the opening of a new street.
Antofagasta is proud of its cemetery. To me it is a nightmare.
Most of the graves are marked with wooden crosses
painted white, many of them being enclosed by picket
fences. The bodies of the poor are thrown naked into a pit
and covered with quicklime. The stench emanating from
this spot is appalling and the litters for the transportation
of the cadavers which are much in evidence in this neighborhood
do not add any attraction to the scene.</p>

<p>
In 1910 a mania struck each resident foreign colony to
donate to the city a reminder of themselves. The British
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375'>[375]</a></span>
colony erected an ornate and useful clock tower in the
Plaza Colon; in the same park the Spaniards built a
bronze monument signifying the Union of the Waters;
the Slavs built a bandstand. In the Plaza Sotomayor the
Germans erected a column to Germania, and the Greeks
gave a statue of a couple of wrestlers. The Chinamen
donated the expensive entrance to the cemetery while the
Turks gave the city the benches which are in the parks.
The North Americans are not represented in these donations,
because at that time the city had only one of our
countrymen as a resident, Mr. William Stevenson, and it
could not be expected that he himself would pay out of his
own pocket a sum of money equivalent to what a whole
colony did out of theirs.</p>

The best hotel in Antofagasta is that named the Francia
y Inglaterra of Nowick and Dutrey; the Grand and the
Belmont are also good. On Sunday Antofagasta is drier
than a powder horn; at least it is supposed to be. But like
in most towns where unwelcome laws are imposed on the
people, they are made to be broken. I judged this to be
the case here from the number of Sunday "drunks" that I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' name='Page_376'>[376]</a></span>
saw being led off to jail, or else encumbering the sidewalks
of the suburbs by reclining on them in a horizontal position.
The lid goes on promptly at five o'clock Saturday afternoon
and the clamp is not taken off until eight o'clock
Monday morning. For violations of the liquor law the
names of those men arrested for being drunk during this
period of drought are published in the Monday newspapers
and stiff fines are imposed upon the vendors of liquid
refreshments that contain an alcoholic percentage. On
Sunday, April 30, 1916, 120 saloon proprietors were fined
for selling drinks. The Quinta Casale proprietor was
fined 1000 pesos (about $200.00), the proprietor of the
Hotel Maury was fined 500 pesos and another saloon-keeper
the same amount. One Saturday night during
this enforcement while I was a guest at the Hotel Francia
y Inglaterra, the three <i>mozos</i> of the second floor of the
hotel got hold of a case of Guinness' stout to which they
proceeded to make short shift of. In their inebriated
condition they started a fight which at first was as near to
the Marquis of Queensbury rules as a triangular affair of its
kind could be. It soon developed into a rough and tumble
and all the participants were put <i>hors de combat</i>. This
occurred during the dinner hour and the unedifying expletives
used which generally accompany such a fracas were
audible to the diners much to the mortification of Nowick
and Dutrey. One of the combatants repaired home
where he attempted to assail his better half with his fist;
she retaliated by seizing a chair and breaking his head. I
related this affair to a North American, a Mr. Rowe, a
resident of Antofagasta. Rowe then told me that a year
previous in La Paz, Bolivia, he was stopping at the Hotel
Guibert. Mr. Guibert did him a trick that angered him,
so he in turn filled up all the servants of Guibert's hotel
to get even. For a whole day there was no service at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377'>[377]</a></span>
Hotel Guibert for all the domestics from the manager to the
cook were roaring drunk and all the guests were forced to
seek other quarters.

<p>
One of the famous characters of Northern Chile and
Bolivia was a brutal bully named McAdoo who was continuously
quarreling with everybody. He died in 1915,
and on his tombstone in Antofagasta his acquaintances had
the inscription carved: "May he rest in peace."</p>

<p>
In 1916 the Antofagasta public was indignant at the
way some of its indigent dead were handled. When an
unknown man or a pauper died, he was dumped into a sack
and a carter was hired to carry the bundle to the cemetery.
These carts are two-wheeled open affairs. If the cemetery
happened to be closed, the carter was apt to drop his
unwholesome burden anywhere. Two or three of these
lichs were found tied up in sacks in different parts of the
city during my sojourn in Antofagasta, which perpetration
was severely excoriated by the newspapers. Speaking of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' name='Page_378'>[378]</a></span>
it to Captain Rowlands of the Pacific Steam Navigation
Company's steamship <i>Guatemala</i>, he related to me an
incident which happened on his ship.
</p>

<p>
A man died of bubonic plague in one of the nitrate ports
but before dying he told a relative that he wished to be
buried in Santiago. This relative was returning to that
city so he tied the corpse in a sack and carried it on
shipboard. As the lower-class Chilenos all carry their
possessions in burlap sacks slung across their backs while
traveling, he managed to get his burden on board unnoticed.
He stowed it underneath his berth, but the odor
was such that he could not sleep so he made friends with
the bartender and hired him to hide it until the ship reached
Valparaiso. The bartender placed the cadaver underneath
the sink in the service bar. The next day Captain Rowlands
smelt a stench while he was making the inspection,
and opening the door of the sink discovered the body,
which he had thrown overboard. The frightened bartender
owned up to his part of the transaction but the passenger,
the relative of the defunct when taken to task retaliated by
threatening the captain with arrest upon the ship's arrival
at Valparaiso. Rowlands told him that he could start
anything he wanted to, but if any arresting was to be done,
it would be the passenger who would be arrested for
breaking Chile's sanitary law.
</p>

<p>
The harbor of Antofagasta is never quiet owing to a heavy
swell and a project is now on hand to build a breakwater.
I boarded the <i>Guatemala</i> at that port with a ticket for
Iquique. It had been over three years since I was a
passenger on that boat and the great improvement on it was
marvelous. In 1913 the food, service, and filth on it were
so abominable, combined with the slipshod actions of the
officers, that I made up my mind never to embark upon
it again. Since Captain Rowlands has been its skipper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_379' name='Page_379'>[379]</a></span>
everything has changed, and it is now one of the cleanest
and most comfortable steamers on the coast. The food
cannot be beaten. One of the passengers on board I found
to be Angel Larrain, the efficient but villainous looking
bearded roustabout whom Prat and I had delegated to
bring our baggage to Lima upon consideration of his
passage.
</p>

<p>
The morning after leaving Antofagasta we arrived at
Gatico, a copper port, where the mountains came down to
the ocean. About a league south of it was seen the small
village of Copoapa on a narrow sandy plain at the foot of
the barren cliffs. Gatico and Tocopilla are the only towns
on the Pacific Coast of South America where copper is
found near to the ocean. There is a smelter at Gatico
and it is up a canyon here that run the wires of the electrical
power plant at Tocopilla to the Chuquicamata mines.
</p>

<p>
Tocopilla is a two hours' run north of Gatico. We
reached it in the early afternoon and remained there all
night taking on cargo. According to the last census it had
5366 inhabitants, although it does not appear to have half
that number of people. Next to Salaverry and Mollendo
it is the vilest hole that I have ever stepped foot into,
although I am told that it is a paradise compared to Pisagua.
It is a long, narrow place, built on a sandy fringe
between the mountains and the sea. Its houses are mostly
one-story frame shacks, the majority unpainted. A
point juts into the ocean off which are two small guano
islands. Near the end of the point is the large electrical
power plant of the Chuquicamata mines. It gets its
power from the ocean, a tunnel having been dug out under
the water and thence upwards so as to cause great pressure.
There has been much trouble on account of the tunnel getting
clogged with seaweed. The Siemens-Schukert Company
of Germany installed the machinery, which has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' name='Page_380'>[380]</a></span>
given such poor satisfaction that I understand the Chuquicamata
Mining Company (Guggenheim interests) have
taken it over under protest.
</p>

<p>
Tocopilla has a comparatively large German element,
most of the male members being employees of the Sloman
Copper Smelter. This plant is on the side of a mountain
and some of its mines are visible from the port.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Tocopilla</p>
</div>

<p>
The town is not only exceedingly wretched in appearance
but also has the reputation of being pestilential.
The captain of the Chilean vessel <i>Condor</i> landed here in
1912 sick with the yellow fever. He recovered but this
pestilence nearly wiped out the whole town. There is no
verdure of any description hereabouts with the exception
of a few plants in front of the houses, the country being a
sandy and a stony waste; the same is true about Antofagasta,
yet in both places mosquitoes thrive. This yellow
fever epidemic was singular because south of Lima
the West Coast of South America has always been absolutely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_381' name='Page_381'>[381]</a></span>
free from it. In 1915 Tocopilla was a closed port
for four months on account of bubonic plague, which is ever
present in the seaport towns from La Serena northward to
Panama.
</p>

<p>
In company with Mr. B. Brice of Valparaiso, accountant
for the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, I took a walk
to the cemetery. The two gates were locked so we started
to walk around it to see if there was another entrance.
Since walking was obnoxious in its neighborhood on
account of tin cans and nondescript rubbish, we made a
detour by going out onto the plain. Suddenly our nostrils
were assailed by a disgusting odor which caused us
to hold our breath. "Look here," said Mr. Brice, pointing
to a myriad of mounds which we had previously taken
to be rubbish piles; we found that they were graves for
at the head of some were wooden crosses and desiccated
bouquets.
</p>

<p>
"I believe that we are in the yellow fever burial
ground," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Possibly," answered Mr. Brice. "Let us ask that
individual," indicating a man in the distance who was
scraping with a stick among the mounds and whose actions
savored of those of a ghoul.
</p>

<p>
Upon asking the "individual," whose appearance was
that of a degenerate, we were informed that we were in the
bubonic plague graveyard.
</p>

<p>
"The yellow fever cemetery is there," he exclaimed,
pointing with evident pride to a large square enclosure
bristling with white crosses.
</p>

<p>
The degenerate creature was carrying a burlap sack
which he dragged on the ground. Through a large hole in
it, we saw red meat and the knee-cap of some animal.
</p>

<p>
"What have you got there?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
The degenerate pointed to the distant carcasses of mules
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' name='Page_382'>[382]</a></span>
rotting in the sun and above which soared carrion. Said
he:
</p>

<p>
"I have just cut off a hock of mule."
</p>

<p>
"What for?"
</p>

<p>
"To eat. One must live, of course."
</p>

<p>
This disgusting habit of feeding on the carcasses of
animals that have died a natural death or through disease
is prevalent among the inhabitants of the arid zones of
Peru and Northern Chile; where probably nowhere else on
earth is the human race so degraded.</p>

<p class='caption'>Cemeteries at Tocopilla
</p>

<p class='caption-sub'>
The mounds in the foreground are the graves of the victims of bubonic plague. The
white wall in the distance encloses the burial ground of the people who died of yellow
fever in the epidemic of 1912. These gruesome cemeteries are the pride of the natives
of the wretched town of Tocopilla.</p>
</div>

<p>
Shortly after leaving Tocopilla, I chancing to be on the
starboard deck of the <i>Guatemala</i> ran into the bearded
ruffian Angel in deep conversation with an English divine.
He was gesticulating during his conversation and would
occasionally point towards land in the direction of the
cemeteries fast vanishing in the distance. I walked up to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383'>[383]</a></span>
the pair, and after turning the topic of conversation to
things commonplace when I approached, Angel made some
excuse and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"A real brilliant man that," said the Anglican, turning
to me. "It is curious how often a rough exterior reveals
great brains."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"You noticed that uncouth bearded man in conversation
with me when you approached. A person unacquainted
with him would imagine him to be one of the
great number of vagabonds that abound on this coast. He
belies his appearance for he is a distinguished professor of
the University of Buenos Aires. He is making a tour
of the West Coast towns studying the causes of bubonic
plague. He is a member of the Argentine Commission on
Bubonic Plague and many interesting things he has told
me about this malady that I have never heard of before."
</p>

<p>
I did not spoil Angel's story by revealing to the Anglican
his real nature. The roustabout had been listening to
a conversation the previous evening between Captain
Rowlands, Mr. Brice, an English army officer, and myself
about bubonic plague and had remembered everything
he heard. Owing to this knowledge he was able to carry
on a fairly intellectual exchange of words on the subject
with the English minister.
</p>

<p>
The so-called harbor of Iquique is no more than a roadstead
with a barrier of rocks jutting into the ocean,
which breaks in two places forming narrow entrances to a
natural basin. The waves beat with violence against
the rocks so the <i>fleteros</i>, as the boatmen are called, are
obliged to wait until a wave has broken and then by quick
rowing speed past the entrances before another wave has
the chance to dash against the barrier.
</p>

<p>
Iquique's population numbers 46,216. In 1907 its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_384' name='Page_384'>[384]</a></span>
population was 40,171, which shows that although Antofagasta
has taken away a great deal of its trade, yet
the city has had a slight increase. There is a great rivalry
between the two cities which is soon bound to cease on
account of Antofagasta having a good commercial future
ahead of it. The nitrate industry of Iquique is on the
wane, and is now confined to the Iquique and the Pisagua
pampas while that of Antofagasta is in its prime. As a
residential place most people prefer Iquique; there is a
large British colony here and the foreigners are of a better
class; among the foreigners in Antofagasta the Slavs
(mostly from Croatia and Dalmatia) predominate and
these were originally the scum of their countries. In
Iquique's favor also are better residences, pretty plazas,
and a fine <i>malecon</i> or sea boulevard with a nice beach.
Nevertheless I prefer Antofagasta because it is cleaner, its
streets are paved, its buildings are more substantial, and it
does not seem so remote, having better railroad facilities.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Iquique</p>
</div>

<p>
Iquique is built in the form of a square on a sandy point
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_385' name='Page_385'>[385]</a></span>
of land. All of its buildings are frame, many of them being
painted brown or dark red. Quite a few have ornamental
balconies, some being of Moorish design. The streets, on
some of which run horse cars, are narrow and straight.
Many have irregularities for some buildings are set farther
back than others and the curbs in these places likewise
recede. The main street is named Tarapacá from the
province of which Iquique is the capital, while the next
important commercial street is that named Anibal Pinto.
Ordinarily the dust on these thoroughfares would be
insupportable, but the municipality has inaugurated the
sprinkling of the streets with sea water. This causes much
dampness in places where the sun does not reach.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Iquique</p>
</div>

<p>
Like most of the West Coast towns of the arid zone,
Iquique is devoid of edificial interest. It has, however, an
imposing opera house, a good city hall, a Moorish tower in
the center of the plaza, and a rather pretty cemetery,
besides some good residences, that of the governor with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_386' name='Page_386'>[386]</a></span>
broad verandas and large plate glass windows being the
finest. The Hotel Ph&oelig;nix, owned by an Italian, Sorbini,
is not at all bad. Here and in Tacna no fruit is served
with the meals provided by the hotel, but native women
perambulate between the tables carrying baskets from
which they sell fruit to the diners. Sometimes these
greasy hags become insulting when a guest refuses to buy
from them.</p>

<p>
Late at night of the evening after leaving Iquique the
lights of two towns close together were visible on shore.
These were Junin and Pisagua, the last mentioned being a
few miles north of its neighbor. Pisagua is a nitrate port
with 4089 inhabitants. Bubonic plague was formerly so
bad there that the town had to be burned down twice.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="s08">ARICA TO ILO OVERLAND, VIA TACNA, TARATA, AND
MOQUEGUA</span>
</h2>

<p>
Arica is seven hours north of Pisagua. Its population
is 4886. It is the pleasantest port on the rainless coast
for in its neighborhood is verdure due to irrigation
from the Lluta River. It looks nice from the steamer's
deck, which appearance is not belied by a visit to the
lower town. The upper town, which extends to the
desert, is a compactly built place of low buildings, but is far
superior to the other coast towns of its size. In the lower
town are the banks, shipping offices, and government buildings.
Its streets are bordered with pepper trees and it
has two cool and pleasant plazas in one of which the
Italian residents have erected a bust to Columbus. Arica
is the port of the provincial capital, Tacna, but its present
importance is due to the opening in 1913 of a railroad to
La Paz, Bolivia, of which city it is also a port. A traveler
is carried to the Bolivian metropolis in twenty-four hours
over a pass thirteen thousand feet high.
</p>

<p>
One of the first things that I did when I arrived in Arica
was to go to the steamship office to find out about the
sailings of the ships on the Chilean Line and of the Pacific
Steam Navigation Company. The agent for both these
lines was the American consul, a man whose name I believe
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388'>[388]</a></span>
was Smith. As I was waiting for information, Smith
himself appeared and he was in an ugly mood. He was a
thin blonde man about fifty years old, bespectacled, and
had red blotches on his face which showed that he was a
heavy drinker. In fact he stunk of liquor. He was an
Englishman and was acting as representative for the
United States.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Arica

<p class='caption-sub'>
This is in the upper town.</p>
</div>

<p>
"Can't you read the schedule?" he inquired, indicating a
time card which hung on the wall of the outer office.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but owing to the ships being overcrowded, I want
to make reservations."
</p>

<p>
"Wait until the ship arrives, then we will sell you a
ticket," he answered hastily and then left the room. This
was a nice fix because if I returned to Arica a few hours
before sailing, it might happen that there would be so
much loading and unloading of merchandise that it
would be too late for me to buy my ticket after getting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_389' name='Page_389'>[389]</a></span>
my passports viséd. There was no use of arguing with
such self-important and gin-soaked individuals as Smith
so I went away trusting to chance. It turned out that
I did not return to Arica to catch the steamer because
I traveled overland to Ilo, the port of Moquegua
in Peru. A half hour after leaving the shipping office I
saw Smith coming out of a <i>cantina</i> or saloon in the lower
town and after walking for about a block he entered
another one. Later on in the afternoon, happening to be
in the barroom of the Hotel Francia, I arrived in time to
see him gulp down a tumbler of gin and follow it up with a
brandy chaser. I stepped up to him and offered to treat
him, mainly to see what mood he would be in, and was surprised
to hear him acquiesce by ordering a half pint of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390'>[390]</a></span>
Guinness' stout. This performance he kept up all day and
I was told by the brother of the hotel proprietress that it
was a daily trick of his.
</p>

<p>
When the <i>Guatemala</i> anchored at Arica a French Calvinist
minister, Dr. Petit, came on board to visit one of
the passengers, the Reverend McLaughlin, a Methodist
Episcopal minister from Buenos Aires. McLaughlin introduced
me to Petit and during the following days at
both Arica and Tacna I became fairly well acquainted with
him. Petit had a degree as a physician but changed his
profession to that of minister of the gospel. He had done
considerable missionary work in South America and had a
church in Arica where he preached. He did not believe
in war but was a strong advocate for divorce; in fact he was
contemplating divorcing his wife whom he claimed was
unfaithful. He was at the present prevented from doing
so because there is no divorce law in South America excepting
Uruguay, and he did not have enough money to go to
Montevideo to start proceedings. He also informed me
that if the husband of the proprietress of the Hotel Francia
was onto his job he would divorce her because that
woman had driven him to distraction by her amours and
her extravagances, so that to avoid domestic scenes the
poor fellow had returned to France, hoping to be killed in
battle to relieve him of his mental anguish. The husband
I understand is an officer. Petit was a truly conscientious
man and was wrapped in his work as missionary; he did
not practice religion as a cloak to cover his sins. In build
he was an athlete.
</p>

<p>
None of Arica's hotels are highly recommendable although
the Hotel de France, or Francia as the natives call
it, is the best. It is run by an accommodating peroxide
or lemon juice blonde Frenchwoman about forty years
old who is heartily sick of Arica and is anxious to sell out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_391' name='Page_391'>[391]</a></span>
This is the woman whom Dr. Petit had no respect for.
The real manager of the hotel is her brother, a good-for-nothing,
powerfully built creature about her age whose
chief pleasure is to emulate Smith's example by overindulgence
in alcoholic refreshments and to argue and
quarrel with the guests.
</p>

<p>
A landmark for miles around is the solitary rock named
the Morro de Arica which towers above the town. It is a
duplicate of Gibraltar, and was one of Peru's last strongholds
during the Pacific War. It was defended in 1880
by a regiment of Bolognesi's troops under Colonel Uguarte.
In the face of a violent storm of rifle bullets, the Chilenos
took the Morro by landing a short distance down the coast
and climbing it from behind. When Uguarte saw that he
had lost he spurred his horse to the brink of the precipice
and jumped to his death several hundred feet below.
Many of his followers did likewise because the Chilenos
had the reputation of taking no captives. The Morro
is now strongly fortified. People are forbidden to make
its ascent and the day before I arrived two men were
thrown into jail for attempting it. In front of the Morro
is a small, low guano island. It is used as a fort and is
honeycombed so that it can hold a force of five hundred
men.
</p>

<p>
The day after we arrived a northbound Chilean steamer
put into the harbor of Arica. On it was Kermit Roosevelt
returning to the United States after having spent some
time in the employ of the National City Bank at Buenos
Aires. We did not know he was on the ship until walking
down one of the streets a man breathlessly hurried towards
us and asked us if either one of us were Señor Roosevelt.
Thinking that some wag had told the gentleman
one of us was Teddy, Prat answered saying that he was
Colonel Roosevelt. Now Prat is a slender, medium-sized
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_392' name='Page_392'>[392]</a></span>
man about thirty years old and clean shaven and I cannot
understand what kind of an ass that Arica gentleman was
when he accepted Prat's statement and believed him. He
stated that there was a delegation already to meet him and
that he himself would accompany him to the <i>cabildo</i> where
a banquet was being arranged. A crowd gathered around
Prat and would have carried him off by force if an Italian
blacksmith had not appeared on the scene who had seen
Colonel Roosevelt and told the natives that a joke was
being played on them.</p>

<p class='caption'>Capitol Building at Tacna</p>
</div>

<p>
The province of Tacna, the most northern in Chile,
formerly belonged to Peru. At the close of the Pacific
War in 1880, Chile, the victor over Peru and Bolivia,
annexed to her already long seacoast the Bolivian province
Antofagasta and the Peruvian province Tarapaca;
Tacna it was only supposed to annex temporarily. Chile
was to occupy it for twenty years; a vote of the inhabitants
was then to be taken to determine which country it should
go to. Thirty-eight years have passed by and still no vote
has been taken. The chances are that it will always remain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393'>[393]</a></span>
Chilean. To keep it so, Chile has seven regiments
in the province, five of which are stationed at Tacna, the
capital city. The present government has tried to Chilenize
the province by planting within its confines men from
the south of the republic so that even in the event of a vote,
which is doubtful, the majority will be in favor of the present
ownership. It is another Alsace and Lorraine question
because Peru is always thinking of the day when it
will get it back and its inhabitants are Peruvian sympathizers.
Peru even goes through the sham of having
Tacna and Arica represented in its congress at Lima.</p>

<p>
Tacna is thirty-eight miles north of Arica. The
connecting railroad is the oldest in South America having
been completed in 1844. The railroad at first skirts a
fertile fringe near the seashore and then crosses a sandy
desert until within a few kilometers of Tacna when it
enters an oasis caused by irrigation from the Caplina
River, all of whose water is drawn off for the gardens so
that none of it empties into the ocean.
</p>

<p>
Tacna lies at an altitude of 2820 feet above sea level but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394'>[394]</a></span>
so imperceptible is the rise that one can imagine it to be on
the same level plain as Arica. The population is 14,176,
including five thousand soldiers. The city appears much
larger. The ordinary transient would carry the impression
that it is a town of twenty-five thousand people. It
is a healthy place yet the death rate exceeds the birth
rate, which state of affairs is true in many old settled towns
all over the world.</p>

</div>
<p>
Tacna is a beautiful place and is well worth a visit. It is
the best built city in Chile and is the only one where the
buildings are of stone. It is opulent,&mdash;a rarity in Chile,&mdash;its
inhabitants are refined, educated, and wealthy. There
are handsome public buildings, large stores, and spacious
houses. In many respects Tacna has a European appearance.
The most noticeable object that strikes one's vision
in the city is a large stone shell of an incompleted cathedral
with two massive stone towers. The square trimming
stones are of a pinkish hue while the ordinary ones are
the dun-colored ones of the country. This huge shell will
never be completed. It was built from the plans of the
French architect, Charles Pitaud, when Tacna was a Peruvian
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395'>[395]</a></span>
city. Then came the Pacific War and the money for
its completion was turned into other channels. Monsieur
Pitaud returned to France; Chile took Tacna, and used
much of the iron for the framework of the cathedral for
military purposes. When everything again became normal,
the people wished again to complete the cathedral.
Pitaud in the meantime had died and his drawings were
never found so it was impossible to complete the building.
In design it was to be much like the Duomo in Florence.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396'>[396]</a></span>
in the Plaza Colon. It was cast in 1868 and is the finest
in the Western Hemisphere. There are more expensive
ones, elaborate sculptures of marble, but none its equal
artistically.</p>

The streets of Tacna are paved, most of them with
round polished stones, and many are bordered with trees
planted along the curbs. There is much verdure and the
city has several shady plazas with statues. There is a
marble one to Columbus in the plaza of the same name.
The Alameda Anibal Pinto is a garden spot. It is a well-kept-up
lovely parkway. A peculiarity of Tacna is the
architecture of many of its residences. These are gabled,
but by far the most have "sawed off" gables. In these the
sides slope upwards as if to form a gable, but about a yard
or more below the imaginary peak, they terminate in a
flat roof. This style is supposed to make them earthquake
resisting.</p>

Of the six Courts of Appeals in the republic, one is at
Tacna. Both Antofagasta and Iquique for a long time
have been trying to get it away for themselves, but so far
have been unsuccessful. Of the five regiments stationed
at Tacna, two are artillery, two are infantry, and one is
cavalry. There was an engineer corps but it has been
moved to Copiapó.</p>

<p>
Tacna has a good hotel, the Raiteri, owned by an Italian
of the same name. His business, which has somewhat
fallen off since the Arica-La Paz railroad has been completed,
is large enough, however, for him to keep two
annexes running. His hotel is one of the best in rural
Chile. The coffee is the best I have had served to me in
South America. There is another hotel named the Tibios
Baños (Warm Baths). It is of the free and easy sort
where when you engage a room the landlord asks you,
"With or without?" and governs the price accordingly.
It has a cool grape arbor where it is pleasant to repair
hot Sunday afternoons for a schuper of beer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_398' name='Page_398'>[398]</a></span>

<p>
In an obscure corner of the province not far from the
Peruvian line lies the high, broad mountain valley of the
Ticalco River, hemmed in on all sides by snow-capped
mountains, the lowest of which is higher than the highest
mountains of North America save McKinley, St. Elias,
and Popocatepetl. The Ticalco is joined by numerous
freshets from the melting snow and like a silver thread
flows through this valley and by great jumps cuts its way
through a gorge before it finally joins with the Salado at
Talapalco to form the Sama, the national boundary with
Peru. Although very high, of all the valleys of the Province
of Tacna, the Ticalco is the most fertile. It is cold;
no fruit excepting the apple thrives, but as a recompense it
is rich in oats and in alfalfa. In this valley and on a small
stream about a mile above where it flows into the Ticalco
River lies the town of Tarata, 9919 feet above sea level.
Its population probably numbers five hundred souls. It
is the third town in size in the Province of Tacna. It is
the capital of a department, newly created, has a court
house and a barracks.</p>

To Tarata I went. Don Santiago Carmona, a rich
<i>haciendero</i> of Tarata, was in Tacna with a caravan of
thirty-one mules and six horses. Accompanying him were
five muleteers. One of the horses he himself rode. Several
times a year he made these trips. He would drive a
herd of cattle the two days' trip into Tacna, sell them, and
return with his mules laden with flour, oil stoves, kerosene,
beans, onions, beds, and blankets. On the narrow streets of
Tacna his caravan made a picturesque sight. I expressed
a desire to see Tarata, and the man to whom I expressed
it, a resident of Tacna but a stranger to me whom I
stopped in front of his residence to inquire into the history
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' name='Page_400'>[400]</a></span>
of the unfinished cathedral and with whom I entered into a
general conversation, said that he would speak to Señor
Carmona asking his permission for me to accompany him
on his return trip. He would let me know the result later
at my hotel. True to his word, late in the afternoon he
appeared at the hotel bar (the place where most business
is transacted in Chilean small towns) bringing with him a
tall, wind-tanned, thin man of about fifty-five years of age
who wore a straggling grayish beard and a moustache
of the Don Quixote type. This man was Don Santiago
Carmona. He said that he was returning home the next
morning and with great politeness and dignity invited me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' name='Page_401'>[401]</a></span>
to accompany him as his guest. This invitation I gladly
accepted and for their kindness I treated both gentlemen to
as much Fernet Branca and vermouth as they could handle,
and then some.</p>

<p>
I made arrangements with Signor Raiteri for three
horses, a mozo, provisions, and blankets. It is certain that
Señor Carmona would have shared blankets with Prat and
myself, but since I did not care to impose upon him we
brought our own equipment which in reality belonged to
Raiteri. As it was Carmona refused to allow me to use
any of the provisions I brought along, but made me eat
from his larder, his mozos doing the cooking.</p>

At eight o'clock in the morning we started from a courtyard
across the street from the market. Now the direct
way out of the city was to follow the Alameda, but Carmona
evidently wishing to inspire the inhabitants with a
reverence for his own importance had his caravan of mules
cross the Alameda and turn up the main street, which
indeed created a general diversion for all the clerks ran to
the sidewalk and the pedestrians halted to view this extraordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402'>[402]</a></span>
cavalcade. At the parochial church we again
turned into the Alameda and followed that avenue the
length of the extremely long town.
</p>

<p>
The valley of the Caplina is narrow, fertile, and is a veritable
garden. One thing I noticed as we left the city
behind. We would come to fields in the height of production
with irrigation ditches full of water. Adjoining
them we would see parched fields of bushes trying to eke
out a meager existence. The flow of water from the Caplina
is not sufficient to supply all the arable land in the
valley. A farmer will raise crops for several years in one
field; then when the soil has run out he will cultivate an
adjoining field, neglecting the first one, and will deviate the
water to the new one. After a few years he will give up
the new field and return to the first one which in the meantime
has been fertilized by nitrate. Since there are but
few cattle on the coastal plain, no manure is used to bring
up the land, but nitrates are easily imported from Pisagua.
On account of nitrates washing away they are put on the
uncultivated land during the period that the fields are not
in use. The road follows the right bank of the stony river
bed whose water has been turned aside to water the
quintas as the small gardens are called. In some spots
there is an intermission of the cultivation where the
sandy desert comes down to the river bed, but the trees
and green gardens always begin again. From this valley
Iquique receives most of its fruits and vegetables.
</p>

<p>
Calientes which we reached after six hours' travel but
which can be reached in one and a half hours by automobile
and in two and a half by carriage, is the place where
we left the road. On our way there we passed through
three hamlets&mdash;Calana, La Vilca, and Pachia. Each has
a cantina and thither Don Santiago, Prat, and myself repaired
to moisten our dusty throats with native red wine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_403' name='Page_403'>[403]</a></span>
while the mules took a breathing spell. The thirsty mozos
stood humbly at one end of the cantina drinking their
wine in silence while we stood at the counter which served
as a bar. Calientes is so named from some hot springs
which here gush forth from the sides of a barren mountain.
They are sulphurous and when the rivulet which springs
from them enters the Caplina, the water is turned black
caused by the precipitate the sulphur of the rivulet makes
with the copper properties of the Caplina. There are
at Calientes but a few huts. Here we unsaddled the
beasts and in the hour's rest the mozos cooked a stew
which served as a midday repast.
</p>

<p>
An hour after leaving Calientes we arrived at a couple of
huts which are called Tacuco and two hours later in the
dim light of the waning day reached the end of the first
day's ride at the hamlet of Challata deep down in the
valley at the foot of Mount Pallagua. The night was cool
and the bountiful meal of cazuela, stew, and vegetables
eaten before a roaring camp-fire with the murmuring of the
rapidly flowing stream at our feet made me rejoice that I
was far away from the sham and inane conventions of
modern city life. A peon offered us his only bed in his hut
but Don Santiago and myself spread our blankets on some
straw pallets in an open shed with the starlit sky for a
canopy, and there we slept until awakened by the sonorous
grunting of sows at dawn.
</p>

<p>
"We have a hard day ahead of us," remarked Señor
Carmona after we forded the Caplina and started the steep
ascent up the sandy side of Pallagua. A high mountain
range to the right had shut off a vista of the snow peaks of
the Cordillera, but upon reaching a stony plateau, suddenly
the high dome of the extinct volcano Tacora, 19,338
feet high reared its lofty summit above the whole eastern
mountain chain. To the northeast appeared Uchusuma,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' name='Page_404'>[404]</a></span>
18,023 feet high, while near at hand were the ice fields of
the Cordillera del Baroso. These high mountains are
visible from Arica, at which port the Andes come nearer
the ocean than at any other place on the South American
continent except Puerto Montt. After two hours' climb up
the barren ridge we reached a spine and then descended
by zigzags to the canyon formed by the Quebracho de
Chero in which grew a few mountain shrubs not unlike
chaparral. In Indian file we followed the narrow trail
between the mountains Pallagua (altitude 13,065 feet) on
the right and Palquilla (altitude 12,415 feet) on the left
and arrived at midday at the Pass of Caquilluca about
12,000 feet above the sea level where we rested a couple of
hours and had our dinner.
</p>

<p>
Behind us all was desert and as we looked westward past
the numerous creases of the earth's surface which were
arid canyons and valleys we could see the limitless expanse
of the blue Pacific Ocean. At our feet to the north and
west lay a valley as green as an emerald traversed by silvery
streams, and dotted with light blue farmhouses. In
the distance was a cluster of buildings which I was told was
Tarata. Hemming in the whole valley were the mountains
whose snowy bulwarks formed a circle leaving only one gap
that in the northwest through which the Ticalco flowed.
These mountains from west to east were Cumaile (altitude
17,095 feet), Vivini (altitude 17,733 feet), Chilicolpa
(altitude 18,303 feet), Chiliculco (altitude, 16,835 feet),
Barroso, and Uchusuma.
</p>

<p>
It was six o'clock in the evening when the caravan,
having clattered over the narrow pebbly streets of Tarata,
pulled up at the Casa de Huespedes (Guests' House) where
I was to spend the night. Señor Carmona made me
acquainted with the fat mixed-breed Vargas who owns the
tambo, and after admonishing him to take good care of me,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405'>[405]</a></span>
he galloped off to his three-league-distant ranch saying that
he would look me up the next afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Tarata does not lie on level ground as it appears from
the mountains above the town. The streets slope steeply
down to the Ticalco which is no more than a creek. Near
its banks is a narrow level stretch of land where the plaza,
town hall, and church stand. This stream not only serves
for irrigating purposes but it is likewise the sole supply for
potable water and for washing purposes. Every morning
its banks are cluttered with half-breed and Indian women
who lay their laundry on the stony slopes of the stream
to dry. On the plaza which is bordered by Lombardy
poplars is a bandstand where twice a week a six-piece band
plays. Beneath these trees is a fringe of alfalfa where
the village cows graze. Like in Tacna the houses have
the same sawed-off gables, and like in that city they are
painted tones of salmon and blue. The town hall is the
only two-story building in the place and with the exception
of the church belfry it is the tallest. The church is a
cream-colored affair with a domed steeple rising from the
center of its façade. On it painted in red is the inscription
"Anno 1808," the date of its founding.
</p>

<p>
Strolling about the village I was surprised to see, through
the windows of the residences, pianos, and one saloon had a
billiard table. It required much labor to bring them here
for all transportation of merchandise is done by mule
back. In the fields were many llamas. They are never
used in carrying burdens to the low altitudes because they
sicken while at work below six thousand feet elevation.
In the high altitudes both llamas and mules are used for
beasts of burden. Horses are employed only for pleasure
riding as they cannot stand the lightness of the atmosphere
to work in. Llamas refuse to carry more than one hundred
pounds burden, and no matter how much beating they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_406' name='Page_406'>[406]</a></span>
receive, are persistent in their refusal to be laden with
more. They are not so docile as they look. Their
method of fighting is to run up and strike one with their
forefeet; they also spit a nauseating substance at a stranger
if he approaches too close to one of them. One of them did
this trick on me and when I assailed it with my riding crop
it struck at me with its forefeet. A kick from me in its
belly only gave me the satisfaction of making it grunt.
Its disgusting saliva nearly ruined a suit of my clothes.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Tarata</p>
</div>

<p>
In the afternoon on the day after my arrival in Tarata,
Señor Carmona came to the Casa de Huespedes and asked
me to call on the priest with him. The latter, Padre
Albarracin lived in an adobe house which had a broad
verandah adjoining the cream-colored church. When we
entered he was sitting in the patio behind a morning-glory
vine talking with two officers of the Chilean army, Captain
Frias and Lieutenant Guzman. They had evidently been
"hitting it up" as was evidenced by several empty quart
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_407' name='Page_407'>[407]</a></span>
bottles of chicha (grape cider) lying about, and also for the
fact that each of the trio held a glass half-filled. We were
invited to join with them in the libation and I discovered
that this drink, ordinarily a temperance beverage, had
fermented to such an extent as to make the imbiber feel
as if he were walking on wires. Shortly after we arrived
the two officers left and the priest invited us to remain
for dinner.
</p>

<p>
He clapped his hands to which a chola girl appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Kill the two game cocks that got whipped last week,
and throw them in the kettle," he commanded.
</p>

<p>
Our conversation turned to hidden treasure and antiquities
which the neighboring mountains are said to be
full of if we can believe legend. Tarata is in the heart of
what once was the great Inca Empire. Upon the advent
of the Spaniards the Incas hid from them the greater part
of their ornaments of silver and gold where they remain
undiscovered to this day. The Spaniards worked the
mines of Peru, Chile, and Bolivia, but they in turn for three
centuries were a prey to the pirates which ravaged the
coast and many of the inhabitants were obliged to bury
their wealth to keep it from them. The Catholic Church
in South America was always wealthy in its amount of
gold ornaments, so when the Inquisition was overthrown,
it was in vogue for the citizens to loot the churches. In
order to save its wealth from rapinous hands, the clergy
sequestered much of its treasure in the mountains. Priests
were murdered by pillaging bands of Indians and with
their death was lost the cue to the hiding-places. Enough
treasure has been found, practically stumbled upon, to give
authenticity that vast amounts have been hidden, but the
only person in modern times that made a fabulously rich
haul was Valverde in Ecuador, who was wise enough when
he found his treasure to return to Spain and die in opulence.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' name='Page_408'>[408]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Padre Albarracin excused himself and soon returned
bringing with him two images several inches long which
he said were Inca idols of silver. He also stated that they
were in good hands because the pagans could not get them
as long as they were in his possession; the drunker he got
the oftener he would repeat this and utter quotations
from the Scripture such as this: "Their idols are of silver
and gold, the work of men's hands. Eyes have they, but
they see not," etc. When he finished he would ask me:
"It applies, does it not? These idols are of silver."
</p>

<p>
Then with a sweep he would send them flying from the
table. Once I ran to pick them up. "Do they please
you?" he asked. I answered in the affirmative. "Then
you may have them," he said. He then expounded on the
great sacrifice he was making saying that these two manikins
were the identical ones Holy Writ referred to and that
they were priceless on account of it.
</p>

<p>
After supper when I was examining one he grabbed it
away from me, climbed on a chair, and placed it on top of a
wardrobe. When I asked him why he did that he replied
that he was hiding it because he feared that I would worship
it. I told him that there was little chance, which
made him quote more Scripture such as: "Let the heathen
rage, and the people imagine a vain thing."
</p>

<p>
When he went to get another bottle of chicha, I removed
the idol from the wardrobe. The other one was lying on
the mantlepiece and I took them both because he gave
them to me. I have shown these idols to many people
and although I have had them stolen several times by
acquaintances, I have always got them back. Regarding
antiquities Señor Carmona made me a present of a plate of
solid silver hand wrought in Cuzco in the end of the sixteenth
century. On its face are the portraits of Pizarro
and of Atahulapa carved in silver. Although it was of no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_409' name='Page_409'>[409]</a></span>
value to Carmona, who would have been unable to sell
it for more than its intrinsic value of metal, I have been
offered three thousand dollars for it which I refused to
consider.
</p>

<p>
Padre Albarracin was getting so drunk that both Don
Santiago and myself excused ourselves soon after supper.
Coming out of the house, Prat stumbled over something
lying in the garden. It was Lieutenant Guzman in full
dress uniform, soused and dead to the world. Things
were just as bad at the Casa de Huespedes. Captain
Frias was asleep with his head on the dining room table,
and Vargas fell down the stairs trying to show Carmona
his room. The cause of the debauch was due to the fact
that Don Santiago brought up much wine, gin, vermouth,
and grape chicha with his mule caravan. The shaking the
chicha got en route augmented its fermentation which
made it as bad as hard cider. The night before when we
arrived he had left six cases to be distributed to the priest,
the alcalde, the intendente, Captain Frias, Vargas, and the
notary.
</p>

<p>
The next day I rode to Carmona's hacienda which is
located about nine miles up the Ticalco River on a level
expanse of land which stretches northward to the stony
slopes of the barren mountain Cumaile. The house itself
is a long, low, rambling affair of adobe which was once
whitewashed, but that so long ago that but little of the
white color is left on its sides. It rains in this region and
the broad tiles of the roof are the only things, I take it,
which prevented the building from being melted by the
rains. A compound originally enclosed the whole building,
flower garden, and adjacent peon and work sheds, but at
the present time only pieces of wall of this compound remain.
It was destroyed in 1881 by the Chilean soldiers
who here besieged the Peruvian landlord who had fortified
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' name='Page_410'>[410]</a></span>
himself and held out behind the walls. Everywhere on
the landscape steers grazed in tall alfalfa, fattening themselves
for the butcher shops of the coast towns.
</p>

<p>
Most of the civil inhabitants of Tacna and Tarata are of
Peruvian origin having either been born there when the
Chilean Province of Tacna formed part of the Peruvian
Province of Moquegua, or are descendants of people born
before the Pacific War. Tacna is an old town of stone
buildings, not at all Chilean in character, but very much
like the larger towns of south central Peru. The natives
have strong Peruvian sympathies and are always living in
hope that some day or other Tacna and Arica will be
returned to Peru. Now this is ridiculous because Chile
has no intention of giving these places up, although the
resources of the Province of Tacna are small. The most
important feature is that Arica is the seaport of La Paz,
Bolivia, and it is well for Chile to retain possession of it.
Tacna was a poor town when it was Peruvian; the majority
of its inhabitants lived in poverty. Since it has become
Chilean, it has prospered and is to-day very wealthy. This
is largely due to live regiments which are stationed there
and which bring money into the town. For the past
thirty years Peru has passed through many changes of governments,
and revolutions have been frequent; it has been
misgoverned and unprogressive. Chile, although it cannot
be called progressive has aims that way but has been
handicapped from the want of money and immigration.
It has only had one revolution; that a small civil war
started by Balmaceda, but in government, progress, and
in everything else is so far ahead of Peru that it seems
incredible that the natives of the Province of Tacna are
desirous of again returning to Peru's revolutionary and
mediæval yoke.
</p>

<p>
Don Santiago Carmona was an exceptional haciendero
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411'>[411]</a></span>
in so far that he is a native Chileno. He left his birthplace,
La Serena, forty years ago and never once has he returned.
His military service was spent not far from Temuco where
his regiment was quartered as a protection to the settlers
against the Araucanian invasions. For this reason he
took no part in the Pacific War. His father died when he
was in the service and he was left with a small fortune.
With this money he bought from the Chilean Government
the hacienda that he now resides upon. The latter had
originally confiscated it from the Peruvian landlord who
had fortified himself there against him. Carmona married
a Peruvian girl from Tacna who had long since died
after having borne two sons. One of these sons is a
haciendero in Ovalle and the other is a priest in Spain.
The latter is figuring on returning shortly to Chile because
he has been offered a sacerdotal office in Santiago. Carmona
has become wealthy and is thinking of making a
a trip for a half-year's duration to his birthplace, thence
to Ovalle, Santiago, and Araucania. He also has a desire
to see Punta Arenas.
</p>

<p>
Prat suggested that since we had come thus far towards
Peru by land that it would be as well to continue it this
way. He had a mortal fear of seasickness to which malady
he was a prey every time he put foot upon a ship no matter
how calm the water was. Now I had no maps with me and
did not know how to get to Peru, although I knew that
Tacna was the northernmost province of Chile and the
boundary line was no great distance away. To get information
on the subject I went to Don Santiago who told
me that Moquegua was the nearest Peruvian city, but that
it was a week distant over a hot, sandy desert, and that
the best way would be for me to return to Arica and go up
the coast by steamer. He said that in Tarata there were
people who had made the horseback ride to Moquegua
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' name='Page_412'>[412]</a></span>
and that it would be possible for me to hire a <i>cholo</i> to
accompany us. I had heard about bandits in the interior
and asked him about it. He answered that highwaymen
existed only in the high mountains near the Bolivian frontier,
and that I would find the few inhabitants in the country
I was contemplating traveling through very docile.
Beyond the Sama River which was Peru, he knew nothing
about the inhabitants but imagined them to be much
the same as on the Chilean side of it. The Peruvian
boundary was not fifteen miles away, yet the hacienderos
of the neighborhood seldom crossed it, and it was as much
of a <i>tierra incognita</i> with them as is the interior of Chihuahua
to the ordinary citizen of El Paso, Texas.
</p>

<p>
At Tarata, through the services of the notary who was an
intimate of Don Santiago, we procured an overgrown boy
of the cholo variety who, after considerable haggling, proposed
to take us to Moquegua for the sum of one hundred
pesos Chileno (less than $20.00). He was to fetch back
the beasts that we were to procure as a loan from Don
Santiago. Having shipped my valise to Lima from Tacna,
I was unencumbered save for the blankets and a few edibles
which I carried. Prat was attired in a Palm Beach suit
and wore a straw sailor hat which looked as much out of
place in this part of the country, where everybody rode in
spurred boots, were clad in ponchos, and wore as head gear
broad-brimmed pointed felt hats, as a snowball in hell.
</p>

<p>
We descended the valley formed by the Ticalco, and
after riding for over an hour came to a place where a stream
from the north, named the Ticaco, joined the Ticalco and
formed the Pistala River. The valley narrowed in and
presently the mountains came down to the stream so
closely that one could with ease throw a stone across the
canyon. A rocky promontory on the left was rounded
and the green, fertile pocket in which Tarata nestles was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_413' name='Page_413'>[413]</a></span>
shut from view. A half-score of adobe huts with red-tile
roofs were arrived at. These constitute the hamlet
of Pistala, all of whose inhabitants are Indians. The
horse trail, instead of descending with the river, keeps on an
even altitude so that it is soon a sheer height of several
hundred feet about it, its way having been dug out of the
shaly rock that constitutes the side of the mountains.
Around a bend is a narrow canyon and down this it zigzags
for half a mile and finally crosses a tiny stream named
the Jaruma, which a mile farther down, jumps into the
Pistala forming a new river&mdash;the Tala. At the ford of the
Jaruma is a primitive mill with a huge water wheel. From
here on to the Sama River is a very steep descent by a
narrow bridle path and very dangerous on account of the
precipices which form a gorge through which the waters of
the Tala rush from shelf to shelf with a roar. On the
narrow mountain path we met a troop of llamas laden
with sugar cane and tubers in charge of three <i>arrieros</i>.
At our approach they leaped onto the rocks above as nimbly
as goats. The arrieros and ourselves had to dismount;
they backed their horses to a ledge and we led ours past
them before mounting again. Where the Tala joins the
Sama it must be two thousand feet lower than Tarata.
This is in a broad valley well cultivated to corn, potatoes,
and alfalfa in which are many mud huts of the natives and
an occasional chapel. The river bed is wide but the stream
itself is narrow and forks out in many channels which every
little way unite again. The Chilean or south side slopes
gently down to the stream in some places leaving a plain
of a mile wide at the water's edge, while the Peruvian
side is mountainous, precipitous, and uncultivated. The
mountains are absolutely destitute of any cultivation. We
continued all day down this river, following the Chilean
side, and camped at night beside a ruined stone wall across
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_414' name='Page_414'>[414]</a></span>
the stream from the Peruvian hamlet of Sambalai Grande,
at an altitude of 3025 feet. During the afternoon the
mountains had receded and their places were taken by high
sandy hills the essence of lonesome desolation. The water
in the river had much diminished having been used largely
for irrigation. I was told that what little there is left is
used for the cane-fields which are plenty about twenty-five
miles farther down. This cane is not made into sugar but
into rum; also much of the cane is cut and is sent up on
mule back to the high country where the natives themselves
ferment it, using the pulp as fodder. Estevan, the
cholo guide, although polite and humble, would never talk
unless spoken to and then he would answer in monosyllables.
Prat and I had no idea how far Moquegua
was for we had no map; Carmona said it would take a week,
but he had never been there. I knew it could not be that
far because Ilo, its port, is only a half-day's steam north of
Arica, and we were now considerably north of that last-mentioned
place. I several times asked Estevan how
far Moquegua was, but to each query he would answer the
highly unintelligent reply of "muy lejo," which translated
into English means "very far," but fails to designate
whether the distance is two kilometers or two thousand
miles. This is an example of a conversation between
Estevan and myself.
</p>

<p>
"How far is Moquegua?" I asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Muy lejo" (very far), he answered.
</p>

<p>
"How far?"
</p>

<p>
"Lejo" (far), was his brilliant answer.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a week's journey?"
</p>

<p>
"Quien sabe" (who knows).
</p>

<p>
"Is it three days away?"
</p>

<p>
"Dios sabe" (God knows).
</p>

<p>
"Can we make it in one day?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' name='Page_415'>[415]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"No, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Can we make it in two days?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, señor."
</p>

<p>
"Can we make it in three days?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not know, señor."
</p>

<p>
"You have made the trip to Moquegua before?"
</p>

<p>
"Si, si, señor" (yes, yes, sir).
</p>

<p>
"And yet you don't remember how long it took you to
make it?"
</p>

<p>
"I have forgotten, señor."
</p>

<p>
The country across the river did not look very inviting
to us and it was decidedly exasperating to be met with
answers of such unintelligence especially as we had to
cross what appeared to be a duplicate of the Mohave
Desert. We forded the shallow Sama to some mud huts
in a field of alfalfa, from one of which waved the washed-out
and dirty cloth which once was the red, white, and red
flag of Peru. No sooner had we reached high ground
than a fat, dirty half-breed, barefooted and wearing filthy
linen trousers beneath a faded blue military coat on the
shoulders of which were red epaulettes, planted himself in
our way and assuming a grandiose air of mock dignity
inquired our business.
</p>

<p>
"We are travelers for Moquegua," I told him.
</p>

<p>
"What is your business there?" he asked insolently.
</p>

<p>
"To visit the town."
</p>

<p>
This reply took some time to penetrate his thick skull.
He pondered over it and then a gleam of intelligence spread
over his fat countenance which, by the way, was smeared
yellow with the yoke of an egg he had just been eating, as
he replied in an interrogative kind of a way:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Ustedes son Judios!" (Ah, you are Jews!)
</p>

<p>
This fat guardian of the frontier had taken Prat and
myself for itinerant Jews. This gentry as well as Turks
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' name='Page_416'>[416]</a></span>
and Armenians occasionally make the rounds of the remote
towns peddling their wares, such as cheap finery, pencils,
looking-glasses, buttons, and so forth. To be called a Jew
without an inflection of the voice is, in Catholic South
America, the height of insult, because it is considered the
vilest reproach one man can give another in the heat of an
argument. The manner in which this officer put the question
to us was meant in the form of a query. Prat, however,
being a Spaniard and a none too amiable one at that
when dealing with the cholos and other mixed breeds,
went into a towering rage and upbraided the official in the
purest and most blasphemous Castillian that he ever
before heard and which caused his overbearing, insolent,
and stupid countenance to change to one of servility.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand pardons, señor," he cringingly broke in,
"but you must understand that I have received my commands
to interrogate strangers entering Peru. Not that
I am in the least interested myself, but the government,
alas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We will pardon you this time but not the next," interposed
Prat, curtly starting to ride off.
</p>

<p>
"Señor, señor," pleaded the official calling to him.
Prat paid no attention. I swung around in my saddle
asking him what he wanted.
</p>

<p>
"Your papers," answered the official. "I would lose
my position if I let you pass without seeing them. The
pay is very small and it is my sole income; the illustrious
señores would not be so ungracious as to wish to see me
lose that?" he entreated.
</p>

<p>
I showed him my passport which he looked at, then
turned upside down, frowningly trying to figure out what
it was.
</p>

<p>
"What nationality are you?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"North American."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417'>[417]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"What language is this paper written in?"
</p>

<p>
"English," I replied.
</p>

<p>
A puzzled look spread over the stupid face of my interlocutor.
</p>

<p>
"How is it then that you have an English passport
since you are a North American?"
</p>

<p>
"English is the language of North America."
</p>

<p>
The official was astounded. "Pardon, señor, but I
thought Spanish was the language of entire America."
</p>

<p>
"You are mistaken," I replied.
</p>

<p>
"How is it then that you gentlemen speak such good
Castillian. You speak it much better than I do."
</p>

<p>
"I learned it in Spain," I answered. "The señor with
me is a Spaniard."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I understand," answered the official. I could see
by his amazed and ignorant look that he did not understand
but was unwilling to have us know the extent of his
ignorance.
</p>

<p>
"We are in a hurry to be on our journey to Moquegua;
you had better return the passport," I said as I tendered
him two silver pieces of the one sol denomination, the
standard monetary unit of Peru. A sol is worth fifty
cents.
</p>

<p>
"Mil gracias, señor, mil gracias," answered the official
thanking me profoundly. Prat, who had ridden on, now
turned back and wanted to know what was delaying me.
He was on the point of letting off steam anew at the
cholo, but upon seeing me give him a tip, he threw a piece
of silver on the ground at the fat official's feet. It was
comical to see the latter grovel in the dust to pick it up.
</p>

<p>
"Adios, señores," he yelled after us as we spurred our
horses into a gallop and were soon lost to sight.
</p>

<p>
Upon our reaching the top of a high, barren hill, a vista
of a parched and sandy, barren imitation of the Sahara
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' name='Page_418'>[418]</a></span>
unveiled itself before us. Everywhere lay the bones of
oxen and mules. This was the horrible desert of Pampa
Zorra about twenty miles wide, which it took us over four
hours to cross, in a hot, desiccating, blazing sun. The
thermometer must have been in excess of 120 degrees
Fahrenheit. With our eyes smarting with dust and our
throats parched (we partook sparingly of the water from
our canteens), we arrived shortly after midday at a dry
ravine named the Coari. Following this downwards
between high hills of shale rock we came in half an hour to
the Curibaya River at the cluster of mud huts and ranch
house of Coari. Here were some green fields of alfalfa
surrounded by eucalyptus trees.
</p>

<p>
The Curibaya River is much like the Sama, only its
river bed is narrower. It also has more water, there being
plenty to wet one's feet in. The reason for this is that
cultivation does not extend as high in its bottom as in the
Sama so less is drawn off for irrigation. About twenty
miles below Coari it widens out into a broad valley of great
fertility; most of its water is used at that point to supply
the large vineyards in that neighborhood. The small
remainder loses itself in the sand and never reaches the
ocean excepting during times of cloudbursts in the mountains.
In the fertile valley is the small city of Locumba,
which is famous for its grapes and wines said to be the best
in Peru. We forded Curibaya before we reached Coari
and then turned eastward again, ascending the valley.
This soon forked the Ilabaya joining it from the north.
The latter is a swiftly rushing and jumping rivulet; our
trail lay up its defile and we must have crossed it two dozen
times in the eight miles that it took us to reach the town of
the same name which is situated in a high open valley,
surrounded on all sides with hills not entirely devoid of
vegetation. The landscape instead of being sandy was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_419' name='Page_419'>[419]</a></span>
rocky and abounded with gray boulders. There were
several varieties of cactus and a plant not unlike the yucca.
</p>

<p>
Ilabaya is a typical town of the coastal region of Peru,
differing greatly from Andean cities in so far that the
houses were all built of adobe. The roofs instead of being
of mud, were tiled, because it rains several times a year in
the summer months and the mud roofs would be washed
away. In Copiapó, where it rains only once in a decade,
and in Tacna where it never rains, the roofs are of mud, but
in Tarata and here, tiles were in evidence. Ilabaya is a
larger place than Tarata, but is a dirtier, and more poverty-stricken
place. It is also a terribly hot place, and swarmed
with flies and vermin; mangy curs abounded and the odor
of the streets abounding with house slops and garbage was
disgusting. There were numerous street stands in front
of which Indian women sat offering for sale melons, oranges,
and pears, but not once during the part of the afternoon
that I was there, did I see any purchaser.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at Ilabaya, Estevan said that we had better
spend the night there because he thought there would be
no water the next stage. We dismounted at a primitive
blacksmith shop where the cholo boy was apparently
known, and carried our grips inside. Our arrival excited
considerable curiosity because much of the male populace
soon arrived on the scene, and at a respective distance
looked us over, and then began to become interested in
our grips and saddlebags. One urchin tried to undo the
straps of my suit case but a threatening blow with my stick
made him desist and seek shelter behind one of the grownup
half-breeds. The usual questions were asked to which
Prat and myself deigned to reply, but strange to say
Estevan found his tongue among those of his own breed
and there was let loose a volume of Babel in the Quichua
language which was surprising to me since I did not realize
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' name='Page_420'>[420]</a></span>
that language had such a large vocabulary. I had forgotten
temporarily that the early padres had translated
the Bible in Quichua and had them printed in that language.
I saw one of these books among the church relics
in Cuzco.
</p>

<p>
I interrupted Estevan's garrulity with a prod of my
stick, and asked him where we were to find lodging.
</p>

<p>
"Quien sabe" (who knows), he whiningly replied in the
singsong tones used by all cholos in their conversation with
their superiors. If a stupid cholo or Indian does not know
what answer to give he invariably says "quien sabe" and
lets it go at that. I expostulated with him telling him
that he must procure for us lodging. This he translated
into his native language to the crowd of spectators. A
small boy in the group said that he thought that a certain
old woman who lived at the end of the town would take in
lodgers and offered to direct us there and carry our grips.
We set out down the long straggling street of adobe hovels
and arriving at our destination found the door was shut.
The boy knocked but no response came. I then banged
on the door with my stick. Presently the head of a withered
hag appeared at a shutter and asked what we wanted.
</p>

<p>
"We want lodging for the night," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, señores, but I am too old," she said. "At the
next street to the right in the second house lives Carmen
Vargas. She is young and makes a business of it!" The
old woman was on the point of closing the shutters when I
called to her again.
</p>

<p>
"You do not understand. We are travelers on our way
to Moquegua and wanted to pay for a room to sleep in
to-night." I then held up a couple of silver soles.
</p>

<p>
"I see. A thousand pardons, señores. I thought that
you were looking for some pleasure with the <i>muchachas</i>.
How much will you pay for a room?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' name='Page_421'>[421]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"One sol apiece."
</p>

<p>
"It is not enough."
</p>

<p>
"We will make it two, if it includes meals."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, señores, but I am a poor woman and must live.
For three soles I can accommodate you."
</p>

<p>
"We agree, but it is expensive."
</p>

<p>
"Look at your room," she said, as she opened the door.
"It is fit for a king." She ushered us into a chamber
which was semi-storeroom and sleeping quarters. Boxes
and dusty bottles littered one side of the floorless apartment,
and spider webs hung from the rafters. There was
an iron cot in the corner on which was a straw pallet but
there were no sheets nor blankets. I spoke to her about
getting another cot and she said she would procure one.
As for blankets, she had none, but since the señores must
have their own, having come from some distance, we could
naturally spread ours on the cots. In the meantime if we
would return about seven she would have for us an excellent
<i>comida</i>.
</p>

<p>
The comida turned out to be a thin soup whose ingredients
were unknown to us and in which floated chicken
feathers. This was followed by a disgusting stew and
some meat of an unknown quality, highly seasoned, which
might have been a camouflage for one of the mangy curs
that abounded in the village.
</p>

<p>
There were plenty of cantinas in the small town and I
assume that they were well patronized from the number of
intoxicated Indians that I counted. Bottled beer from
the Cerveceria Alemana at Arequipa here sold for fifty centavos
(25 cents) a bottle and was drunk warm. Strong
liquor was much cheaper than beer and was likewise more
favored. There were quite a few young dudes in the village
and at evening they appeared togged up to what they
considered perfection, wearing carefully polished patent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' name='Page_422'>[422]</a></span>
leather shoes, high stiff collars, flowing black ties; all
carried canes. This stylish dressing among the males is in
vogue all over South America. It is a sign of caste or class
distinction. It is the ambition of all young men to be
dressed in the height of fashion no matter how remote their
village is from the beaten road of civilization. I have seen
this same class of dudes everywhere south of Panama, from
the isolated mountain towns of Colombia to the mosquito-infested
hamlets of Paraguay. There is also a class distinction
in traveling. A man who rides on horseback is
superior to one who rides on a mule; he who rides on a mule
is superior to the one who travels on the back of a donkey.
But beware not to travel on foot in the Andean countries,
even though it be a pleasure jaunt for a short distance
in the country. The pedestrian is looked down upon by
the lowliest peons and is held by them in greater odium
than the hobo is held by us at home. Good clothes and
high collars cease to show caste when applied to the person
who makes a foot tour. He will invariably be turned
down when asking for lodging or meals en route. It is
also wise not to travel on foot on account of the ferocious
dogs to be met with, which never run out and bark at the
equestrian.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Ilabaya, Peru</p>
</div>

<p>
About nine o'clock that night while walking down the
only thoroughfare that could go by the name of street,
I met Prat at a corner conversing with a dandy, who like
Prat wore a straw hat and sported a slender cane. "This
is my compatriot," said he; "allow me to introduce you to
my friend, Señor Güell." The dude bowed and Prat
went on to explain that his new acquaintance was a Catalonian
from Gerona and had been in Peru for four years,
the last two of which he had spent in the employ of a wine
merchant of Locumba. Güell said that Moquegua was but
a short day's ride which was not at all tiresome. He had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_423' name='Page_423'>[423]</a></span>
made the trip dozens of times for his firm and was thinking
of doing so again in a few days. He was at present in Ilabaya
collecting some debts for his employer. I left the
Spaniards on the corner conversing and strode off to the
hut where I was rooming. I went into the room assigned
to us, and although there was another cot there, there were
no blankets. The cholo, Estevan, had evidently forgotten
to bring them although at six o'clock he had promised
faithfully to do so in "un momentito, señor." I walked
back to the blacksmith shop where we had unsaddled but
found that like all the other buildings closed for the night.
As it would have been impossible to find Estevan, I returned
to the dingy hut and throwing my coat on the cot
in the place of a pillow I lay down on the iron springs and
tried to sleep. This was impossible. At midnight Prat
had not returned nor had he come back by five o'clock
in the morning. There was no need worrying about him
because he was perfectly capable of taking care of himself,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_424' name='Page_424'>[424]</a></span>
but I was at the same time at a loss to conjecture where
he was. At six o'clock, finding that any attempt to slumber
would be futile, I went out into the street and walked
about.
</p>

<p>
I went to the blacksmith shop which was about to open
for the day to inquire about the horses. The blacksmith
was already there and when questioned about Estevan
merely answered, "Quien sabe," and then went on about
his work. Presently the same boy that had conducted me
to the house where I obtained lodging appeared and asked
me if I was looking for my arriero. I replied that I was,
whereupon the urchin said in his patois, "Se scapo,"
which in Castillian would be "e scapado," meaning "he
has escaped."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"He has run away."
</p>

<p>
"He has run away? What do you mean by that?"
</p>

<p>
"He sold the horses and has run away."
</p>

<p>
At that encouraging piece of intelligence, several other
boys appeared and from their conversation I gathered that
Estevan the previous night had sold the horses with blankets
to a mountaineer and that he had then taken French
leave. You may imagine my anger, especially since the
horses were but a loan to us from Don Santiago Carmona
and were worth at least seventy-five dollars apiece in
North American money. When I asked if anybody knew
where Prat was, they volunteered the information that he
and a friend of his were visiting some young ladies. This
was a new one on me since Prat was absolutely unknown
in Ilabaya and no young ladies that I knew of would entertain
two guests so late as this.
</p>

<p>
"Which young ladies is he calling on?" I inquired,
mystified.
</p>

<p>
"On la Carmen; she lives near the end of the village."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_425' name='Page_425'>[425]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It now dawned upon me that Prat was at the bagnio of
Carmen Vargas and that accounted for him not showing up
at the hut. I proceeded down the street to rout him out
but had not gone far before I ran into him and Güell, both
in a state of intoxication. Prat was just emerging from
the jovial stage and was entering upon an ugly mood.
Save for his bloodshot eyes and the reek of alcohol, he was
as immaculate as ever, but the dude was a sight to behold.
His side and back were covered with dust; only one flap of
his collar was buttoned, the other flying in the air; his hair
was unkempt, and his hat was awry. He could hardly
steady himself on his feet and was leaning on Prat to keep
his balance. At the same time he was trying to sing a
stanza from the Cid.
</p>

<p>
"Hail to the glorious Carmen, the light of Peru!" he
yelled upon espying me.
</p>

<p>
I told Prat immediately what had happened. At first
he did not understand, but when I repeated that Estevan
had sold our horses and run away, great was his rage. He
drew out his knife and shrieked what he would do to the
cholo when he caught him. The news sobered him up
considerably, so much so that when Güell burst out again
in another stanza, he told him to shut up and cease his
idiotic prattle in case he himself did not care to feel the
knife between his ribs instead of between Estevan's. We
went again to the blacksmith shop where Prat started
upbraiding the blacksmith, and then went to the alcalde's
residence. That official was asleep but Prat insisted on
having him wakened. Presently he appeared attired in
his pajamas. He wanted to know the meaning of this
disturbance and was on the point of telling us to go to the
infernal regions when he suddenly realized that we were
foreigners of distinction, due to the stiff collars and quality
of our wearing apparel. His demeanor changed and he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_426' name='Page_426'>[426]</a></span>
invited us inside, saying that he would dress and talk with
us directly. He ushered us into a well furnished apartment
and left us. We heard him ordering breakfast,
yelling to a servant to prepare three places as he had as
guests two "milords ingleses."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i451" id="i451"></a>
<img src="images/i-451.jpg" width="540" height="235" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Alameda, Moquegua</p>
</div>

<p>
During the meal, which was spread on a table beneath
a vine trellis in the patio, the alcalde, Don José Vergara,
asked us the nature of our visit, to which narrative he did
not reply, stating that he would take the matter up with us
again after breakfast. In the meantime he plied us with
many questions about North America, most of which Prat
answered&mdash;wrong. The latter had never been there nor
could he speak English well, the extent of his vocabulary
being "bulldog," "dollars," "all right," "good-night," etc.
He now converses fluently in English. His ignorance of
that language was not known to the mayor, who himself
spoke an execrable patois although he was a pure-blooded
white man. When we said that we wanted to start as soon
as possible for Moquegua, the alcalde implored us to remain
a few days in Ilabaya as his guests. When we told
him it was imperative for us to continue, he promised us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_427' name='Page_427'>[427]</a></span>
horses and a man from his stable who would accompany us.
He also said that he would apprehend Estevan and see
that he would be sent to prison if he had not already
escaped to Chile.
</p>

<p>
"What will he get?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"At least twenty years," he answered. "I shall see to
it."
</p>

<p>
"Is not that pretty severe?"
</p>

<p>
"Severe, nothing. One of my friends has an estancia
where labor is badly needed. You see that he will be put
to work profitably."
</p>

<p>
Don José ordered the blacksmith summoned to his
presence, and when that individual presently was brought
before him, the alcalde, threatening him with all sorts of
physical evils, elucidated from him that the previous night
Estevan had called for the horses which were corralled
behind the shop stating that the "señores ingleses" were
about to continue to Moquegua, saying they preferred to
travel at night instead of during the heat of the day. Not
long afterwards his boy had seen a mountaineer driving
them laden with goods up a road that leads into the Andes.
The boy asked him what he was doing with the horses since
they belonged to the "señores ingleses," whereupon the
mountaineer answered that he had bought them from the
mozo Estevan for fifteen soles each. The mountaineer the
blacksmith added was well known to him, was an honest
man, and frequently came to Ilabaya. The next time he
came he would inform Don José of his presence so that the
latter could deal with him. I have always believed that
the blacksmith had a hand in this deal and that he was hiding
Estevan who had mysteriously disappeared after the
transaction. At Moquegua I wrote Don Santiago Carmona
telling him what happened. Six months later I
received a reply when at home in the United States saying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_428' name='Page_428'>[428]</a></span>
that he had never heard a word about Estevan and the
horses, although he had heard rumors that the alcalde of
Ilabaya was riding one of them. Since Ilabaya was in
Peru it was useless to go there for he would receive no
justice.</p>

<p class='caption'>Street in Moquegua</p>
</div>

<p>
Although Don José Vergara said that he would loan us
the horses, when we were about to depart he came to me
and said that it would cost us twenty-five soles ($12.50) for
their rent. This was reasonable enough according to the
standards of civilization but was exorbitant for that locality.
It was after ten o'clock in the morning before we
got away. For about ten miles the trail led over a rocky
plateau and then came to the edge of a precipice at the
bottom of which was the bed of the Cinto River, here dry.
Here were three mud huts and a cistern half full of water,
which was drawn from some springs a few miles up the
valley. We remained here about an hour during which we
cooked some meat and potatoes that we had brought with
us; we pushed on again across another plateau similar to
the one which we had just traversed excepting that it was
sandier and smoother riding. At nightfall we came out on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_429' name='Page_429'>[429]</a></span>
a nose of a hill and saw below us in the distance the lights
of a city which we knew was Moquegua. An hour later
we clattered over the flinty pavement of the narrow streets
and pulled up at the portals of the Hotel Lima, one of the
best in rural Peru. A large well-ventilated room, electric
lights, and the noise of locomotive whistles made us feel
that we had again reached civilization.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i454" id="i454"></a>
<img src="images/i-454.jpg" width="299" height="374" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Street in Moquegua</p>
</div>

<p>
Moquegua is a fine old town on a river of the same name
and capital of the province of Moquegua, lying at an altitude
of over four thousand feet above sea level in the
center of a rich agricultural district, abounding in olives.
These and raisins are the chief exports of the district.
</p>

<p>
The city has a population of nine thousand and
much resembles Tacna on account of the substantial
buildings; it is not as lively as Tacna, due to the former
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_430' name='Page_430'>[430]</a></span>
place having stationed there five regiments, but otherwise
it is a pleasanter town. It is higher, cooler, and there is
more verdure. The valley itself is a long, broad ribbon of
cultivation, mostly devoted to the growing of grapes.
Moquegua is connected to its port, Ilo, by a railroad sixty-five
miles long.
</p>

<p>
Before the Pacific War, Moquegua was a wealthy town
and larger than at the present time; since then many of the
inhabitants emigrated, many going to Arequipa and to
Lima. The alameda, though much neglected, shows
signs of former grandeur, which is testified by the broken
statues and cracked stone benches which formerly were
the pride of the city. Moquegua has the name of being a
very religious place; it has many churches and its streets
swarm with priests, in this respect being much different
from the Chilean towns that I had just visited.
</p>

<p>
Ilo is a small port of about two thousand inhabitants,
very poor and squalid but not so much so as Mollendo.
In both these places bubonic plague is rife, but strange to
say that malady has never mounted as high as Arequipa
or Moquegua. At Ilo I boarded a small postal steamer
of the Peruvian Line and after a few hours' steam we
anchored off the cliffs of Mollendo, the most dangerous
landing place on the Pacific Ocean. The swell is so great
here that sometimes passengers have to wait two weeks
before it has subsided enough to permit them to embark
on the steamers. I had to transfer to another ship here
because the one I was on touched at all the small ports and
took a week to reach Callao.
</p>

<p>
Mollendo is one of the dirtiest towns that I have ever
visited and I have visited some "hot" ones. It is a
bubonic stricken place of about five thousand inhabitants,
according to the census reports, although I doubt
if its population is in excess of three thousand. A steep
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_431' name='Page_431'>[431]</a></span>
incline up a cliff leads from the dock past the custom
house to the stinking Hotel Ferrocarril, the only hostelry
in the town. This ramshackle old building, painted
dark green, is situated on an eminence at the extreme
southwest corner of the town, at a street corner. A
veranda runs around the street sides of it, onto which
the rooms open. Beggars, hobos, cripples, bums, and
dogs bask on the sun-warped boards of its floor, and
sneak-thieves are ever watching for an opportunity of
entering the dirty holes which are the guests' rooms. The
dining room and the barroom are the only adjuncts of the
institution which are kept clean, and the latter is the most
lucrative enterprise to its owners of any business establishment
in the town. It has several billiard tables of doubtful
cues and cushions and to them at the noon hour repair
all the German clerks of the mercantile establishments.
There is much liquor sold and much drunkenness to be
observed. At one corner of the room sat a well-dressed
aged man. He had the palsy so badly that he could not
lift a glass to his mouth so he sat there imbibing whiskey
and soda through a rubber tube that extended from his
mouth to the glass. The Hotel Ferrocarril is owned by
a couple of Italians who are fast waxing wealthy. It is
hell to stay in Mollendo even for an hour and the travelers
are to be pitied who stop here days at a time waiting for
their steamers which run on uncertain schedules.
</p>

<p>
The place owes its importance to the fact that it is the
port of the large and prosperous city of Arequipa about
seventy-five miles inland, and that it is the outlet and port
of entry of the Lake Titicaca basin, and of the historic
and interesting old city of Cuzco, the pristine capital of
the Inca Empire, three days distant by rail. Formerly
Mollendo was the seaport of La Paz, Bolivia's quaint metropolis,
but now traffic has been changed from that city,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_432' name='Page_432'>[432]</a></span>
so that Arica and Antofagasta get the bulk of its trade.
There has been much talk of transferring the port of Arequipa
to Islay, a settlement a few miles north of Mollendo
in a sheltered location, but the merchants at Mollendo
made a strong kick about it, and bribed the politicians at
Lima, so that the scheme never matured. At Mollendo,
my Peruvian money ran out because I did not get enough
Chilean money changed at Arica, and I had a hard job
getting change here. Some Italian bankers to whom I
applied knew how badly I wanted Peruvian currency, so
accordingly discounted my Chilean money so much that I
must have lost twenty-five dollars by the transaction.
</p>

<p>
As I said before, Mollendo is a hotbed for bubonic
plague. Several people die daily of it here, but its mention
is suppressed by the health authorities so as not to
give a black eye to the town. When a person dies of it, it
is kept quiet and the victim is buried at night. Northeast
of the town is the potter's field. Here graves eighteen
inches deep are dug. The cadaver is trussed up by having
its feet drawn back to its haunches by means of a cord tied
around the shoulders and is thrown into the impromptu
grave. I was told by several people that so poorly is the
job done that sometimes the toes protrude above the ground
and are nibbled at by buzzards and by starving dogs.
</p>

<p>
From Mollendo, I went to Callao on the Chilean steamship
<i>Limari</i>. It was a good ship but rolled considerably
even in a calm sea. It took three days to make Lima's
busy port, no stops being made, but from the deck I could
see the dim outlines of the towns Lobos, Chala, and Pisco.
An acquaintance of mine, Mr. Kurt Waldemar Linn, of
New York, a German by birth but a naturalized American
citizen, who is connected with the International Film
Company, told me in Santiago that he expected to be on
this boat and arrive in Lima at the same time I would.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_433' name='Page_433'>[433]</a></span>
I failed to find his name on the passenger list and when I
arrived in Lima, he had not yet shown up. The next day
he appeared, having disembarked from the Pacific Steam
Navigation Company's steamship <i>Mexico</i>. He said he
was sorry that he had not made the trip on the <i>Limari</i>,
and that never again would he make a trip on any ship of
the Pacific Steam Navigation Company if he could help it.
He said that the service and food on the <i>Mexico</i> were vile
but to crown his discomfiture one morning at breakfast
the first officer who sat next to him asked him how he
slept the previous night.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't sleep very well," answered Mr. Linn. "There
was too much noise going on."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, there was a good bit of noise on board. We
caught a German spy last night and that caused the
racket." At this witty remark the officer looked at Linn
and winked. The latter did not relish this sort of pleasantry
even though it was meant in fun.
</p>

<p>
At Callao the custom house officials are careful to ransack
all one's belongings looking for things dutiable and
those non-dutiable as well; on the latter they levy private
duties for their own pockets. There is much red tape and
tipping to be done and nowhere else in my travels have I
been subjected to so much annoyance at a custom house
unless it was at Belgrade, Servia. Hotel couriers meet
the steamers and it is advisable for the traveler to give his
possessions in charge of one of these men who will relieve
him of the trouble connected with the custom house and
transferal of baggage to Lima. The courier expects a
large tip, but it is more convenient to give it in one lump
sum to him than to have to run the gauntlet.

<h2>
CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="s08">LIMA</span>
</h2>

<p>
Although the chapters of this book are supposed to
treat only of the southern republics of South America, it
would nevertheless be a shame not to mention Lima and
the Peruvian hinterland, therefore this and the following
chapter.
</p>

<p>
Callao, the port of Lima, where the ships anchor,
has a population of forty-five thousand. It is here that
one first gets an idea of genuine Peruvian architecture.
The two and three storied houses, many of which are
adorned by steeples and towers, invariably have enclosed
wooden balconies projecting from the second floor over the
street, giving the touch of old Stamboul or other oriental
cities. It is difficult to conjecture the origin of these balconies.
The Moorish style of architecture which the Spaniards
copied and brought to their colonies was plain, with
bare outside walls and few windows. This Turkish style
seen by many tourists for the first time in their lives at
Callao is that which predominates in Central Peru and is
also prevalent to a certain extent as far south as Tacna.
</p>

<p>
In Callao there is but little to interest the stranger.
As in most seaports, tough characters abound, and there
is a bevy of saloons; but unlike most seaports, Callao is
comparatively clean, especially the show places. It has
a large church, a few pleasant plazas, and some marble
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_435' name='Page_435'>[435]</a></span>
statues. In reputation it is one of the toughest towns in
the world; it formerly was the jumping-off place for criminals
and the tales of shanghaiing and murders that took
place here not so many years back would fill volumes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i460" id="i460"></a>
<img src="images/i-460.jpg" width="542" height="351" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Callao Harbor</p>
</div>

<p>
The harbor is landlocked by the mainland, a sandy
point, and the mountainous island of San Lorenzo. The
port works of stone are the best on the whole Pacific
Coast but at the present time no ships anchor at them.
This is due to the prevalence of bubonic plague (occasionally
a few sporadic cases) which can be transmitted to the
passengers and crews through the medium of rats. A
reason more vital to the municipality for not allowing the
ships to anchor at the docks is that of providing employment
for the <i>fleteros</i>, or boatmen, who earn a few soles by
rowing people and baggage to and from the ships. In the
harbor are two Peruvian men-of-war. They have lain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' name='Page_436'>[436]</a></span>
there several years. Their boilers are defective and their
machinery needs repairing, but nothing is ever done to
make them seaworthy. I saw the admiral in a street car.
He is a big, fat fellow with about a fifty-three inch waist
line, and resplendent with gold braid. From the servile
humility of the conductor and the passengers towards him,
one might judge that he ranked with von Tirpitz and I
have no doubt but that he entertained the same opinion
of himself.
</p>

<p>
Lima is about five miles distant inland from Callao, to
which city it is connected by a trolley and two railway
lines. The former, double-tracked, runs in a straight line
through a decidedly Athenian landscape. On all sides are
green fields, olive groves, black hills, and whitish soil.
The air, odor, and decisive clearness of the atmosphere is
Attic; the style of the country houses, nature of the crops,
and appearance of the live stock is analogous to that
of Attica. On the south side of the main road are two
large country seats that would grace any rural scene; they
are the residences of the Italian families Castagnone
and Nosiglia, and are set back at some distance from the
turnpike.
</p>

<p>
The population of Lima, Callao, and many of the seaboard
Peruvian towns is composed of Aryans, Indians,
Hamitics, and Mongolians, with a conglomerate mixture
of all four races. In Lima, people with mixed white and
Indian blood predominate; those of mixed white and negro
blood are a close second. The aristocracy and better-to-do
classes are white and are descended from the Spaniards.
They do not marry outside of their own race and constitute
the ruling element. There is a large Italian colony,
many of whose male members are leading merchants and
professional men. Far outnumbering the whites are the
various hues of mixed breeds, Indians, negroes, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' name='Page_437'>[437]</a></span>
Chinese, which form the rabble. The cholo is a scion of an
Indian and a white person, while a <i>chino-cholo</i> is the offspring
of a Chinaman and an Indian. To get a good idea
of Peruvian mixture as applied to the lower walks of society
(which constitute all the classes not belonging to the
white race, and which greatly predominate), one can take
the following genealogical tree as an example. A white
man marries a squaw which we can designate as union A.
A Chinaman marries a negress; we can call this union B.
The progeny of union A marries the progeny of union B,
which is union C. The result is a child which has blood
one fourth white, one fourth black, one fourth Indian,
and one fourth Chinese. Although mixtures like this are
uncommon, they nevertheless exist, but it is of great
commonness for a person to have the blood of three of these
races.
</p>

<p>
These mixtures diminish the intellect and decrease the
vitality of the offspring, who are invariably inferior to the
pure bloods, even if the pure blood is Indian or negro.
The children of these marriages inherit few of the good
qualities of their parents, but all of their vices. The
cholos, proud of their white blood, tyrannize over the poor
Indians and subject them to indignities and cruelties such
as were never practiced in slavery times by their Spanish
masters. These same cholos cringe like curs before the
white man. Their natural disposition is good, excepting
that they have the trait of dreadfully abusing and misusing
the poor Indians. The Chinese, of which there are thirty
thousand in the provinces of Callao and Lima, have not
intermarried with the other races so much as the other
three mentioned ones. They are lawabiding and quiet,
but the mixed offspring from them is deficient in good
qualities. The worst of all races in Peru is the offspring of
the negro and the cholo. The result is a progeny that is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_438' name='Page_438'>[438]</a></span>
downright bad. It is these that constitute the riotous
mobs that murder and hurl missiles every time there is an
abortive or a genuine revolution. They do not know
what the row is about, yet they want to participate in it
for the main love of wickedness. I saw a crowd of this
degenerate gentry, evidently "egged on" by some political
opponent, hurl legumes and bricks at the brother of ex-President
Leguia when he was leaving the Doric-columned
Senate Building. One of these bricks severely injured a
stranger, and I, an unconscious spectator, had a white duck
suit discolored by unsavory hen fruit. The Limeno bootblacks
are recruited from this class, and as a rule when
they are not shining shoes or up to some deviltry, they
stand around the booths singing in an undertone obscene
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_439' name='Page_439'>[439]</a></span>
stanzas of their own composition to attentive dregs of
humanity. The "buck-niggers" and their families, of
untarnished ebony hue, originally migrated into Peru
from Jamaica. They do not make bad citizens, but their
population is fast diminishing, their numbers becoming
assimilated with the other races.</p>

<p class='caption'>Puente Vieja, Lima, as Seen from the Bed of the Rimac</p>
</div>

<p>
There is considerable material for argument relative to
the origin of the name of the Peruvian metropolis, which
nobody seems to have taken the pains to unravel. Lima
was founded January 18, 1535, by Don Francisco Pizarro.
It was granted its charter and received its seal by a royal
decree of Charles V. of Spain, December 7, 1537, under
the name of the Most Noble and Very Loyal City of Kings.
The name Lima, which the stranger is erroneously told is a
corruption of the word Rimac (the name of the river which
divides the modern city), was said to be the name of the
Indian village which had its center where the capitol building
now stands; owing to the shortness of its name, it superceded
the longer title given to it by the Spanish king.
Many of the Spanish conquistadores named cities which
they founded in the new world after cities in Spain from
which they hailed. Thus Trujillo in Peru is named after
Trujillo in Spain, Pizarro's birthplace. There is a town
named Valladolid in Yucatan, a city named Cartagena in
Colombia, a Cordóba in Argentina, and a Linares in
Chile. All of these places were named after places of the
same name in the Iberian Peninsula. Likewise there is a
Lima in Spain. It may be that the capital of Peru was
named after it, and that the name of the Indian village is
legend. To substantiate this theory, there is a city in central
Brazil named Lima which is an old town. This
Brazilian city would undoubtedly owe the origin of its
name to the same source as would Lima, Peru. There is a
theory however which would knock this out and that is one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_440' name='Page_440'>[440]</a></span>
of my own. Lima, Spain, only appears on the modern
maps of that country. It is a small town in Leon. I have
examined many maps and ancient geographies of Spain
and do not find it there, yet it is inconceivable that Lima,
Spain, would be named after Lima, Peru.</p>

<p class='caption'>Calle Huallaga, Lima</p>
</div>

<p>
The variety of large bean which at home we are accustomed
to call the Lima bean is not a native of this place.
Their origin is a town named Ica, which is about a hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_441' name='Page_441'>[441]</a></span>
miles southeast of Lima, and in Peru it is called the Ica
bean.
</p>

<p>
Lima is divided into two uneven parts by the Rimac
River, which is spanned by two traffic bridges, the Puente
Vieja, commonly known as the Stone Bridge, and the
Puente Balta, by a railroad bridge, and by a temporary
footbridge. The Rimac is a swiftly flowing, transparent
stream, which jumps over cascades and has a considerable
volume of water for a mountain stream. Its bed is not
well defined as it contains many small islands and gravel
bars. At the stone bridge it is kept within bounds. The
river furnishes irrigation for the whole valley in which the
capital is situated and could even be made to furnish more
since much of its volume of water goes to waste. This is a
crime on account of its scarcity.</p>

<p>
Lima should not be passed without a week's sojourn by
any visitor to the west coast of South America, whether
he is a professor, antiquarian, commercial traveler, or
ordinary tourist. No other city in the Western Hemisphere
retains in so marked a degree its medievalism, yet
no other city on the west coast of South America is so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_442' name='Page_442'>[442]</a></span>
advanced in modernity. Luxury rubs shoulders with
poverty; there are numerous palaces and also countless
hovels. The great churches, all Roman Catholic, bear
testimony by their superb interiors to the lavishness of
devotion. In the shop windows are displayed the silver
ornaments and utensils of Cuzco and Cajamarca; next
door to them are presented the baubles and gewgaws of
New York and Paris.</p>

<p class='caption'>Plazuela de la Inquisicion, Lima</p>
</div>

<p>
The population is estimated at two hundred thousand
which is probably nearly correct. The city is very compactly
built and centered so that its streets teem with
more life than an ordinary city of the same number of
inhabitants. Although its population is but half that of
Santiago, this centralization makes it appear to be a larger
place. The buildings, two, three, and four stories in
height, are massive, although many are built of adobe,
plastered and painted over, and give the city a metropolitan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_443' name='Page_443'>[443]</a></span>
appearance. In Santiago many of the merchants and
well-to-do inhabitants live in the suburbs; in Lima they
reside near the center of the city. During the past few
years, the Peruvian capital has made great strides in civic
improvement. The main streets are now paved with
stone; they were formerly paved with sharp pebbles.
They are kept clean, which is a great contrast to the dusty
offal which formerly littered them and which in powdered
form assailed the eyes and nostrils of the pedestrians every
time a gust of wind arose. The equipages for the transportation
of passengers are superior to those of Santiago
and the street car service, although not frequent enough,
is better than that of the Chilean capital. There has also
been much recent building going on, the new edifices being
of modern European design.
</p>

<p>
Standing in the Hotel Maury one day I was introduced
to a prominent Lima business man named Arthur Field,
who was born there. He kindly offered to show me the
city in his automobile. I told him that I was already
acquainted with Lima, having made previous visits there.
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad," said he; "most tourists go away with
such a poor impression of Lima, and some go away after a
short sojourn and write most uncomplimentary things
about it, which hurts it. Ambassador Bryce spoke very
illy of Lima, and he was only here for a few days. There
is to my knowledge only one book written recently which
gives a true description of the city. It was written by a
namesake of yours, a man named Stephens. My wife
and my friends have read it, and they all pronounce it as
true."
</p>

<p>
I did not tell him that I wrote the book, but another
man in the group, an American, spotted me for its author
from the frontispiece in it, which has my likeness. This
last-mentioned man went home that noon, and verified his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_444' name='Page_444'>[444]</a></span>
suspicions by again looking at the frontispiece. That
afternoon he procured his copy of the book and started to
the Hotel Maury to congratulate me. On the way he got
gloriously drunk, and in an inebriated condition he showed
the paragraph where I mentioned the Hotel Maury to one
of its proprietors. Since I had spoken poorly of the establishment
in it (it had improved decidedly since I was
there before) I thought the result would be a request for me
to change quarters. The proprietor could speak no English
and judging that the talk of the American was due to
an excess of <i>batida</i> bitters and John de Kuyper paid no
attention to the subject.</p>

<p>
A bad feature about Lima is that the same street has a
different name for each block. This was the old Spanish
custom and it makes it necessary for the visitor to buy a
plan of the city to memorize the nomenclatures of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_445' name='Page_445'>[445]</a></span>
principal blocks. In recent years the municipality has
tried to remedy this custom by giving a street one single
name, but the old appellations still cling and probably
always will. The Calle Union, Lima's main street, is not
so called by the ordinary native, and its different blocks
are known as Palacio, Portal de Escribanos, Mercaderes,
Espaderos, Merced, Baquijano, Boza, San Juan de Dios,
Belen, Juan Simon, and so forth. Its principal sector,
Calle Huallaga, is known respectively as Judios, Melchormalo,
Virreina, Concepcion, Presa, Lechugal, and
San Andres.
</p>

<p>
Calle Union presents much life. It begins at the Plaza
de Armas and is about a mile long, terminating at the
Zoölogical Gardens. On it is the city hall, several theaters,
the Merced church, the Forero palace, and the penitentiary.
It is the main retail street and is always much
crowded. Huallaga is a busy street with antiquarian
shops, banks, and wholesale offices. On it is the Hotel
Central, the Bank of Peru and London, the Concepcion
market, the Concepcion church, and the police headquarters.
</p>

<p>
The Concepcion market is the largest that I have ever
seen. Its ground area, covering a whole block, is about the
same size as the Tacon market in Havana, but it is higher.
There are many queer vegetables, herbs, and fruits offered
for sale which are unknown in Europe or in North America.
The potato, whose origin is Peru, is sold in this market,
not in the raw state as in our markets, but desiccated.
The natives soak them in water, sun dry them, and put
them for sale in this fashion, for this way they will keep
indefinitely. In the meat department cats crawl over the
loins and spare ribs while whippets snap at fly-bedizened
bones. I attempted to take a time exposure of the place
but a gawky overgrown boy walked in front of the camera,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_446' name='Page_446'>[446]</a></span>
spoiling the picture. A cuff on the ears from me which
sent him spinning against a basket of eggs nearly caused
a small riot.
</p>

<p>
The Bank of Peru and London is the largest bank building
in South America. It is a three-story white structure
built in a classical style of architecture. There are several
other large banks.
</p>

<p>
The Plaza de Armas lacks much of the charm of the
plazas in the Chilean cities. It is planted to palmetto
trees, which I think always look out of place outside of
their wild native state. On the north side of this square is
the one-story-high capitol building. Somewhere in its
patio is the spot where Pizarro was murdered. The exact
place is not known on account of the many alterations that
have taken place in the building. His skeleton rests in a
white marble sarcophagus in the cathedral.
</p>

<p>
This cathedral, whose stately and magnificent pile was
described by me in a previous book on South America,
ranks as one of the largest religious edifices in the world.
Its twin towers, one at each side of a broad façade, rise
majestically into the heavens and are visible from a great
distance. Its spacious nave and aisles are crowned by a
ribbed roof, whose ceiling is painted in symmetrical designs
in pink and azure. Many mendicants loiter about
the interior, and when the sexton shows you Pizarro's
skeleton, they all solicit alms for such trivialities as holding
the candle to view the remains, opening the door of the
chapel, and so forth. In the chapel where his remains
repose is an altar of pure silver brought from Cuzco.</p>

<p class='caption'>Façade of San Augustin Church, Lima</p>
</div>

<p>
Lima, always the capital of the Spanish dominion in the
New World, and the seat of the Inquisition in South
America, was and is still a pillar of Catholicism. The
plaza where the Senate building is located is named the
Plazuela de la Inquisicion; in its neighborhood were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' name='Page_448'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_447' name='Page_447'>[447]</a></span>
perpetrated the barbarous tortures on heretics, written
about in Vicuña Mackenna's books. Joints were stretched
by screws; ear holes were filled with molten metal; writhing
bodies to whose feet was tied an iron hundredweight
were hoisted by outstretched arms to the ceiling by means
of pulleys, the weight causing the body to tear in two at the
abdomen. The last of these barbarities took place in
1820. In Peru no other religion but the Roman Catholic
is recognized, although others are tolerated. Watching a
religious procession one day as it passed through the
streets of the city, a thirty-second-degree Mason turned to
me and said:
</p>

<p>
"A Mason has no more show in this town than a fly on
fly-paper."
</p>

<p>
There are forty-eight large churches in Lima and
twenty-two chapels. The latter are large enough to be
fair-sized churches in the United States. The most aristocratic
church is that of La Merced adjoining the convent
of the same name on the Calle Union. It has an opulent
interior. The nave is high and airy, and the air is laden
with frankincense. It is my favorite of all the Lima
churches and I often repaired thither to attend mass or
for pious meditation. San Francisco church is very rich;
its architecture is Saracenic. Another fine church is San
Augustin. It has a marvelous sculptured façade. According
to the original plan, it was to have two towers but they
have never been added. It is here that the president takes
his oath of office. Other fine churches worthy of visit are
San Domingo, San Pedro, and Nazarenas, although many
others present great interest.</p>

<p class='caption'>Procession of the Milagro, Lima</p>
</div>

<p>
Easter week in Lima is an unforgettable event. Penitents,
carrying holy images, processions, and throngs of
religious devotees fill the streets. One of the pageants
which has a touch of barbaric mingled with Christianity is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_450' name='Page_450'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_449' name='Page_449'>[449]</a></span>
that of the Milagro. What gives it a touch of the barbaric
is the majority of negroes who take part in it. The trail
of the Milagro lies through the squalid streets in the part
of the city north of the Rimac. All the people officiating
are garbed in purple tunics. It is preceded by youths
carrying gaudy lamps. Then follow negro women, chanting
dirges. A stranger looking at it for the first time is apt
to believe that it is a procession exorcising against the
plague for after the cantors come black Mary Magdalene's
carrying lighted hand braziers from which they blow
great fumes of incense smoke on the onlookers, nearly
suffocating many by the intoxicating fragrance. There
is a brass band of purple-robed devotees playing weird
music followed by an image of the Saviour in an upright
position mounted on a metal platform. This image is
adorned with wreaths, flowers, and ribbons; before it is an
altar with lighted candles. The platform is very heavy
and is borne by sixteen men, four on each side, four in
front, and four in back, who support its weight on their
padded shoulders on which rest beams. The procession
is very slow, moving at a snail's pace, and as it proceeds,
the pageant sways with a peculiar serpentine rhythm. On
account of the weight of the image and its accouterments,
at every few yards the procession stops and the carriers are
relayed. Some of them faint under the strain. The expression
on the faces of the carriers is that of most reverend
devotion; the light of sanctity is in their eyes, and they
walk as if in a trance. This carrying of the image is a
great honor, and the fortunate ones look forward to it for
a whole year. Following the image walked a priest, his
well-fed form protected from the sun by a canopy of cloth
of gold upheld on poles by six purple-clad boys. His
expression was far from being that of sanctity. Merciless
and unrelentless, his face wore a heartless and cold-blooded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_451' name='Page_451'>[451]</a></span>
mien as if he were a graven image of stone. Smug
and self-centered, he appeared to be greatly contented
with the position he occupied, the cynosure of all eyes.
When the procession passed the Calle Trujillo, the main
street of the section of Lima north of the Rimac, street
car and pedestrian traffic was stopped for half an hour.
As in all places, there was a crowd of procession followers.
As the pageant merely crawled along, many youths of this
class regaled themselves with libations of <i>pisco</i> which is
offered for sale every few doors in that neighborhood.
The consequence was that there were many staggering
steps among the spectators.
</p>

<p>
Lima is seen to its greatest advantage from the middle of
the stone bridge at dusk when the electric lights are being
turned on or after dark on a moonlight night from the same
spot. The view is far superior to that of Florence as
seen from the Arno bridge. In the daytime the masses of
chrome-colored houses, churches, and towers, the teeming
street life, the trains arriving at and leaving Desamparados
station present the aspect of a metropolis both medieval
and modern. At night when the white moon rising above
San Cristobal hill plays on the ripples of the Rimac, and
reflects on them the myriads of lights from the windows,
while in the distance the trees along the river bank cause
an inky blackness, is seen a picture beyond the scope of
the greatest artists.
</p>

<p>
The part of Lima north of the Rimac is much the smallest,
but it is the most thickly settled. It is the dirtiest
part and is the favorite abode of negroes and Chinamen;
here street dogs of all descriptions constantinopolize
the thoroughfares, and when not basking on their bellies
on the sidewalks, they devour mule manure and snap at
fleas. This is the section of the city where the bubonic
plague cases sporadically occur, as well as being the section
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_452' name='Page_452'>[452]</a></span>
most poignant in crime. It has a handsome parkway
with statues, the Alameda de los Descalzos, though it would
be better located if it were south of the river. On the
north side are the two breweries, which with the exception
of two flour mills are Lima's sole factories. The breweries
are Backus &amp; Johnston Company, Ltd., and Eduardo
Harster's Piedra Liza Brewery. Above the suburb of
Piedra Liza rises San Cristobal hill (altitude 1300 feet)
which is 179 feet higher than the hill of the same name at
Santiago, Chile. Its summit is crowned by a wireless station
of the Telefunken.
</p>

<p>
In Lima there is only one hotel at which a North American
or a European can stop in comfort, the Maury.
This hotel, owned by Angel Bertolotto and leased to Visconti
&amp; Velasquez, is with the exception of some of the
Buenos Aires hotels the best in South America. Many
of the rooms have baths and are sumptuously furnished.
The prices are high. This Hotel Maury started with one
building on the corner of Bodegones and Villalta but when
trade increased, it was necessary to acquire the adjoining
buildings, so that at the present time the caravanserai
extends the length of the whole block as far as the cathedral.
It is as intricate as a maze to find one's way about
the upstairs corridors. The ground floor is occupied with
several tile-paved dining rooms, and a large bar where
congregate many of the foreign residents to enjoy libations.
The bartenders are good mixologists, but devote
too much of their time selling to tourists at usurious prices
guide books and views of Peru that they obtained for a
song. When they are not doing this they are busily
engaged in drying orange peels that they fished out of
somebody's already consumed cocktail in order to have it
in proper condition to put into a cocktail ordered by the
next customer. The other hotels in Lima, impossible for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_453' name='Page_453'>[453]</a></span>
the foreigner, are the delight of the native-born population,
as the Maury is too expensive for their pocketbooks.
There are many pastry and confectionery stores in Lima,
some being very good ones. These all sell ice cream and
specialize in preparing banquets. Many have ice manufacturing
establishments in connection with them. The
best known are those named Arturo Field, Broggi, Marron,
and Parisienne.
</p>

<p>
The finest café on the west coast of America is the one in
Lima named Palais Concert and is owned by the Maury
proprietors. It is modern European, and is supposed to
have a Viennese orchestra, none of whom, however, hail
from Austria. A popular restaurant is the Estrasburgo.
The peculiarity about it is the sacrilegious mural painting
in it, which strange to say is tolerated in this most
fanatically religious country. The painting is an advertisement
of a French brandy firm. The hideous corpse of
Lazarus, with pointed chin and ears, coming to life, is rising
from a coffin, and with a sardonic grin on his face he is
eagerly stretching out his hand for a tumbler of brandy
which is being handed him by a bleached-out Christ,
garbed in red, and with glistening ringlets of peroxide
colored hair. Christ is saying: "Arise, O Lazarus, and
drink this brandy!" This Estrasburgo is a favorite resort
of Jews in transit. They go there to view this picture,
and when they see that no Christian is present, nudge each
other and say: "This is fine." The Restaurant Berlin is
a well furnished place on the Plateros de San Pedro.
This is all. There is no Berlin about it excepting the
name, although I understand that the proprietor is a
German. The uncouth waiters, some with repulsive boils
on their faces, shuffle across the unswept floor, which is
overrun with cockroaches, and slop down vile concoctions
in front of you, spilling the sticky liquid on the fly-infested
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_454' name='Page_454'>[454]</a></span>
table. One night while sitting there with a friend, I was
given a curaçao flavored with turpentine, while he drew a
cocktail savored with the cholo waiter's dirty thumb.
</p>

<p>
One of Lima's institutions is drink. Being almost a
teetotaler, I can give no more information than what I
observed. Saloons exist everywhere; there are over six
thousand of them, some of which are really high class.
Also there are clubs where liquid refreshments are sold.
There are no days when the saloons are compelled to close;
they generally close their doors at night only when business
becomes slack. Besides the two breweries in Lima
there is one in Callao, and although there is much beer sold,
the predominance of mixed drinks is so much greater that
the former is put into the background. The beer is vile
and I was advised not to drink any of it. In the winter of
1916 two mozos of the Hotel Maury drank a bottle of
Nacional Pilsen (Callao) behind a door when the boss
was not looking. Five minutes afterwards one mozo died
from the effects, and the life of the other was barely saved.
Another man drank some Backus &amp; Johnston beer.
Shortly afterwards his teeth and tongue turned black.
In both these cases it was found that the beer was mixed
with powerful acids. The reason for this has not yet been
discovered. It is believed by some people that the preparation
was faulty; by others that it was the work of a
rival brewery. Most of the confectionery stores have
bars. Broggi invented a drink which goes by his name.
It is called Broggi bitters. This is the recipe:&mdash;Aperitàl,
cane syrup, and a dash of Angostura. To this is added a
lemon rind that has been soaked in alcohol. Add cracked
ice and fill the glass with syphon water. Shake well and
pour the liquid through a strainer. Broggi bitters may
be obtained anywhere in Lima but they do not taste like
the ones served at the original place. The Maury specializes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_455' name='Page_455'>[455]</a></span>
in Peruvian cocktails. This drink is pisco, lemon juice,
and a teaspoonful of sugar. To it is added a few drops of
Angostura; it is then shaken with cracked ice, strained, and
served with an orange rind.
</p>

<p>
Pisco is a terribly strong native drink and is indulged in
by the lower classes. It is grape alcohol, and is flavored
with pineapple, or raspberry, or orange, or prunes. It is
seen in the cheap saloons, standing in large glass jars,
yellow, red, orange, or brown according to the flavor of the
ingredient syrup. Chicha, far from being like the grape
cider of Chile, is here a corn alcohol and is indulged in by
the scum for their debauches.
</p>

<p>
I was once in Lima when there was much money in
circulation. The crowds of foreign residents of the mining
towns in the Cordillera and the floating population used
to hie to the Maury bar twice a day to spend it, and great
orgies were pulled off. This has changed materially, for
now with less money in circulation, there are no more of
these parties. Formerly one never saw any paper currency.
Now one never sees any gold. Several of the
banks in consolidation have issued circular checks which
are considered by the government as legal. They are the
best looking bills in South America. Their denominations
are half pound, one pound, five and ten pound notes. The
merchants grab all the silver soles that fall into their
hands, so that it is impossible many times to change these
circular checks when change is most needed. Some merchants
place signs in their stores saying that this paper
currency will not be accepted as tender unless the purchases
amount to two soles. I was told by the cashier of the
Bank of Peru and London that if I went into a café,
bought and drank a bottle of beer, and offered one of these
checks in payment, the proprietors would be obliged to
change it even though they had signs posted to the contrary.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_456' name='Page_456'>[456]</a></span>
He said that if they refused to make change for me
to walk off without paying and the law would be on my
side. I told this to a chance acquaintance from Montana
who had a perpetual thirst. He tried it out by making
diurnal rounds of many saloons, drinking two or three
potations in each place, always tendering a circular check
of one of the higher values, which he invariably found
unchangeable.
</p>

<p>
Lima has the only ice-cream soda fountains that I have
discovered south of the Equator although I am told that
one exists in Buenos Aires. It also has a soft drink parlor,
Leonard's, called the Hemaglobino, where ordinary soda
water with the standard, and to us exotic, syrups, such as
tamarind, are dispensed. As to money making, it is a
mint, and as Prat remarked to me, in Buenos Aires it
would be a veritable gold mine.
</p>

<p>
A Lima institution that needs to be ameliorated is the
post office department. None of the South American
post offices are any too reliable but that of Lima is the
limit. A few instances of post office irregularities in the
Latin republics will serve as an introduction before that of
Lima is dealt with.
</p>

<p>
In Paraguay it happens that the post offices frequently
run shy of stamps. A person in Asuncion would like to
mail a letter. He takes it to the post office and is told that
there are no stamps but that if he will pay the money
equivalent to the postage the letter will be forwarded.
He does so, and it is the last he or anybody else ever sees
of the letter. It is opened by the post office clerk to see if
it contains money. If it does, the money finds its way into
the clerk's pocket. In any case the letter is thrown into
the waste-paper basket.
</p>

<p>
In enlightened Argentina, there is also much thievery
of mail. A mail car was recently wrecked on the Central
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_457' name='Page_457'>[457]</a></span>
Argentine Railroad. Between the lining of the car and
the outside boards hundreds of opened registered letters
were found. A postmaster in a small Argentine village
died recently. In remodeling the building which was used
as the post office there were found in the basement four
thousand opened letters.
</p>

<p>
In Santiago I was advised by my friends to send them
no registered mail. They told me if I did, they would
probably never receive it because it was common for the
post office clerks to open registered mail to see if it contained
money. In Argentina and in Bolivia the post
office clerks are discourteous and hate to make change.
They gossip with their friends, keeping a row of people
waiting indefinitely for service. Oftentimes they are
busily engaged in reading a newspaper and will not look up
until the article is read. In Ecuador with the exception
of the city of Guayaquil there is no money order service,
and letters are not forwarded if the addressee changes his
residence. In Peru there is no money order service between
Lima and the mining towns such as Cerro de Pasco.
Many foreigners live in this last-mentioned town and it is
often necessary for people in the capital to remit money to
them. In order to do so, it is necessary for the remitter
to go to a bank and purchase a draft.
</p>

<p>
Regarding the Lima post office, thievery is rampant.
I bought some Panama hats in Paita and had them sewed
up neatly in several parcels which I mailed to friends in
the United States. The parcels arrived with practically
the identical sewing that I had done, but when they were
opened they were found to contain newspapers. A letter
to the United States from Lima requires twelve centavos
postage and a postal card four centavos. When a foreigner
goes to this post office and looks around for the
stamp window he is invariably accosted by several individuals
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_458' name='Page_458'>[458]</a></span>
who inquire if he wishes to buy any stamps.
Upon their being answered in the affirmative, they inquire
what denomination he wants. If he should tell them that
he wants to buy some twelve centavo stamps they will
produce a bunch of them which they will sell him for eight
centavos. They also sell four centavo stamps for two and
three centavos. Many of these stamps are minus gum.
This shows that the post office clerks are in league with
these touts. They take off the new stamps, throw the
letters in the waste-paper basket, hand the stamps to their
understudies, who whack up the profits with them. These
clerks also steal new stamps from the drawers and peddle
them out the same way.
</p>

<p>
In Lima, Montevideo, and Asuncion, the post office
clerks also do a lucrative business in selling canceled
stamps to collectors. They will invariably ask the foreigner
if he wishes to buy a set of the current issue canceled.
If he refuses they are offended.
</p>

<p>
Peru is very fertile in the stamp issues that it has put
forth ever since postage stamps have been invented.
Fortunately for collectors, Peru is considered a good country,
as many of its stamps bring high prices in London,
New York, and Paris. The natives know this and there is
not to be found a booth in Lima which sells stationery,
lead pencils, cigars, and lottery tickets which does not also
sell canceled postage stamps of the past issues of the
country. These can be bought very cheaply, and can be
resold in the United States at fancy prices.
</p>

<p>
Peru can be called a lawless country. It has a good code
but its laws are not lived up to. There have been many
revolutions and there will be a continuance of them due to
its lawless, heterogeneous population, and the political
rivalry between different factions. Most of the inhabitants
have political ambitions on account of the graft
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_459' name='Page_459'>[459]</a></span>
connected with the appointments. Although this is true
all over the world, it is especially true in Peru. The cholo
maltreats the Indian, and the white man bullies the cholo.
The Lima police very seldom arrest a foreigner because
they can work him for money. I know of an American
in Lima who through some act of his got into conflict
with the police. They led him off ostensibly to jail, but
when they reached a dark street they asked him how much
he would give if they let him go. They willingly accepted
ten pesos. One night I made a purchase in one of the
stores. After having paid for it, I took my purchase and
walked out into the street. I had scarcely taken a few
steps before the proprietor ran out of his store and told me
that I had not paid him enough because he had discovered
that what he sold me was worth more than he charged
me. This is a favorite South American dodge and is
perpetrated by storekeepers when they think they can get
more for their goods than what they sold them for. Even
the proprietor of a large importing drug firm in Arequipa
tried this on me once, and he was a man worth over one
hundred thousand dollars. I declined to pay the Lima
storekeeper any more money and also declined to give up
my purchase. A half block away stood several policemen
and he sent a friend after one of these. The cops soon
appeared on the scene and started to make a big fuss.
Ordinarily I would have returned the purchase but this
happened to be something that I wanted. When the
policemen, storekeeper, and bystanders were at the pitch
of excitement, I managed to slip a couple of pesos into the
hands of the former. They immediately changed their
attitude, threatened the storekeeper and his friend with
arrest, espoused my cause, and even went with me as far
as the door of the Hotel Maury to "protect me from
molestation" as they called it.

<p>
A certain Lima senator not long ago caught his wife in a
compromising act with a stranger. He had them both
arrested on a charge of adultery. He hired the police to
castrate the stranger, which was done in the jail. No
proceedings were ever taken against the senator and the
stranger was given short notice to leave the city.</p>

<p class='caption'>Cercado Church, Lima</p>
</div>

<p>
The General Cemetery of Lima is worthy of a visit.
It is situated outside of the city limits, east of a suburb
named Cercado. From the Plaza Santa Ana, the best
way to reach it is by the long, populous, and none too
straight Calle Junin on which is passed the ancient salmon-colored
church of Carmen in front of a shady plazuela. I
once saw a vulture the size of an eagle perched on the top of
one of the iron framework crosses that ennoble its exterior.
Several long blocks beyond it is Cercado, now inside the
corporation of Lima but formerly a separate village,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_461' name='Page_461'>[461]</a></span>
founded in 1586, and given the name Santiago. Its present
name, Cercado, is derived from the Spanish <i>circuido</i>
meaning "surrounded," because the town was formerly
surrounded with walls. At the end of one of its tortuous
streets is an insane asylum of such a forbidding character
that the epithet over its gate, "Let all who enter leave hope
behind," can be properly applied. In its garden is a well
where the attendants duck the refractory imbeciles till
bubbles come up. Behind the asylum is the Plaza de
Cercado, treeless, and traversed by an open sewer. Here
is situated the ancient, dull drab, towered church, also
named Cercado. A prolongation of the Calle Ancahs,
here a broad avenue, bordered on both sides by large
trees, leads directly to the cemetery.</p>

<p>
The General Cemetery possesses some of the finest works
of marble monumental sculpture in South America.
These masterpieces were done before the Pacific War in
1879 when Peru was an opulent country, and was not in
the decadent and revolutionary state that it is in at the
present time. Personally I do not like this cemetery
because it is enclosed with high walls into which are set
thousands of niches, a true Roman columbarium. Even
in sunny daylight, it presents an ultra mournful appearance,
no doubt due to congestion of room. If ever there
was a City of the Dead, this is one. Near the main
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' name='Page_463'>[463]</a></span>
entrance is a pantheon, which must be passed through before
reaching the cemetery proper. In front of it is a semi-rotunda
bordered by exquisite marble busts and likenesses
of Peru's famous dead of more than a half century ago.
These are finely chiselled masterpieces of soft white
gypsum-like marble, preserving to the present time their
original aspects. These unblemished, untarnished sculptural
likenesses are of statesmen, professors, and so forth,
dignified, with nothing in common with the uncouth rabble
of Lima to-day. It is just as well that the men whose
remains are interred beneath these pedestals have long
since died for they have not witnessed the humiliating
defeat of their fatherland and the surrender of the nitrate
fields of Iquique, together with the loss of Tacna and Arica,
nor did they hear the tramp through Lima's streets of the
Chilean conquerors.</p>

<p>
Beyond the pantheon are some fine mausoleums, that
of the Goyeneche being remarkable. The cadavers are
not sequestered in the tombs, but in niches in vaults
underneath reached by a descending flight of stairs. The
niches rent for six soles for two years ($1.50 a year) and in
them are deposited the remains of those whose means are
limited. A white marble slab generally covers the front
of the niche. On these slabs are designs, differing but little
from each other in originality. The paintings on the slabs
are black and depict a willow tree on one of whose branches
sits an owl. Beneath the tree in attitudes of prayer and
mourning are shown several human beings grouped about
a corpse lying on a couch. The infant mortality in Lima
must be great as is evidenced by the number of fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_465' name='Page_465'>[465]</a></span>
cement fillings over the niches that are just large enough
to permit the coffin of a child to be placed in the aperture.
I witnessed several burials of poor children. The father,
mother, and a few relatives appear at the cemetery carrying
a coffin, smoking cigarettes, and apparently no more
absorbed with grief than if a pet dog or cat had died. A
cemetery employee relieves them of their load and finds a
niche. He climbs upon some boards stretched across a
pair of wooden carpenter's horses and slides into the hole
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_466' name='Page_466'>[466]</a></span>
that which had once been human. He then seizes a
cement slab, many of which are lying about, having been
especially manufactured for the cemetery to be used on
such occasions, fits it in the niche end, and slaps over it a
few trowelfuls of wet cement. A scratch on the cement
with a pointed stick writes the name of the deceased infant
and the date of its succumbing. The work of interring is
so slipshodly done that swarms of insects, which delight
in making repasts on the putrefying entrails of corpses,
crawl through the cracks of the cement and seethe on the
faces of the slabs. Some of these bit me and caused
festering sores by their undetectable inoculation.</p>

In the west end of this cemetery is another pantheon,
this one superb. In it are the sarcophagi of General
Bolognesi, Admiral Grau, and other heroes of the Pacific
War. It also contains the bones of the former presidents.
Protestants, pagans, and freemasons are not interred in this
cemetery.

<p>
Lima has a patron saint, Santa Rosa. She is also the
patron saint of Callao. She was born in Lima, April 30,
1536, and devoted a life of purity to God. She died at the
age of thirty-one years, August 23, 1567. She was canonized
by Pope Clement X. in 1671.

There are many legends printed in book form about the
city of Mexico, but none that I know of about this much
more interesting city, Lima. Anecdotes and tales of the
early history of Buenos Aires and Bahia would be worth
reading, but I doubt if there is any city of the Western
Hemisphere which is as rich in romance as Peru's capital.
Some of the old houses here could tell many interesting
tales if walls could speak, especially that one still existing
called the Torre-Tagle house, where the Spanish viceroys
formerly resided. It has a beautiful mahogany ceiling
and balustrades and is the home of the Zevallos family.

<h2>
CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="s08">ACROSS THE CORDILLERA TO THE RIO TAMBO</span>
</h2>

<p>
Professor Edward Alsworth Ross in his book <i>South of
Panama</i> says of Peru:
</p>

<p>
"Were I to be exiled, and confined the rest of my life
to one country, I should choose Peru. Here is every altitude,
every climate, every scene. The lifeless desert and
the teeming jungle, the hottest lowlands and the bleakest
highlands, heaven-piercing peaks and rivers raving through
canyons&mdash;all in Peru. The crassest heathenism flourishes
two days in the saddle from noble cathedrals, and the bustling
ports are counterpoised by secluded inland towns
where the past lies miraculously preserved like the mummy
of the saint in a crypt."
</p>

<p>
The greatest part of Peru lies east of the Andes. It is
also the least known part of Peru for it is rarely visited by
strangers or mining men or commercial travelers. The
part they see is the desert coast line with its dirty, poverty-stricken
towns, the bleak barren peaks that fringe the
Pacific littoral, here and there a spot of verdure at the
mouth of a river, and Lima, the capital. A few others,
mostly mining men and engineers, take a trip to the
summit of nearby mountains on the Oroya railroad,
sojourn in the mining towns, suffer from cold and lonesomeness,
and swear that Peru is the damnedest country on
the face of the globe, and are heartily glad when the time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_471' name='Page_471'>[471]</a></span>
comes for them to leave, vowing never to return again.
Barely a handful of these people ever cross the passes of
the eastern cordillera, and descend the banks of the rivulets
formed from the melting of the perpetual snows until
these rivulets become streams, the country opens out,
and the climate changes from that of the arctic regions to
that of the temperate zone and finally changes again to
that of the tropics. If the tourist journeyed farther he
would find himself in a vast forest of tropical trees, impenetrable,
and the home of wild Indians of the blowpipe variety,
who roam the great swamps and jungles clad not even
in a loin cloth. He would meet mighty rivers as wide as
our widest ones, would observe flora such as is only seen
in our hothouses, and would see many species of fauna
which he has never seen except at a zoo. This great, and
for the most part unexplored, section of Peru is part of the
Amazon watershed and forms a wilderness of forest which
is the continuation of that of Brazil. The Amazon and
many of its tributaries rise near the summits of the Andes,
and cutting their passage in deep gorges and canyons ever
widening in their descent down the eastern slope of the
great barrier range of mountains, finally reach the lowlands
and flow peacefully in the direction of the Atlantic
Ocean, their volume of water being continually augmented
by an inpour of thousands of similar smaller streams.
</p>

<p>
A person who is at the mouth of a great river longs to
follow it up to its source, likewise a person standing at the
source or at the side of a little stream which he can step
across and know that thousands of miles away it flows into
the ocean as a mighty river, is fascinated and a longing
comes over him to descend it and follow it to its outlet,
especially if it happens to be in a country that is new to
him and the course of the flowing road lies through a
stretch of the universe that to him is an unsolved mystery.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_472' name='Page_472'>[472]</a></span>
Twice before I have stood at the sources of tributaries to
the Amazon, and each time I could hardly resist the
temptation of following them downward. Once was at
Huancayo on the Mantaro. This river flows eastward
and joins the Apurimac, forming the Rio Tambo. The latter
joins the Urubamba, forming the Ucayali. The Ucayali
joins the Maranon, forming the main stream of the Amazon.
The other time was at La Paz at the headwaters of the
Chuquillampo. This river descends very steeply through
a wild gorge named the Yungas and flows into the Altamachi.
The latter flows into the Beni which in turn empties
into the Madeira. The Madeira flows into the Amazon.
As I was limited for time on each of these previous occasions
I had to forego the pleasure and excitement of such a
thrilling expedition. Also the descent of either of these
rivers would have been impracticable without a large expedition
because their courses lie through a country inhabited
by savage Indians which would make traveling
extremely dangerous.
</p>

<p>
In Lima this time the idea occurred to me, since I had
been twice thwarted in my desire to descend the length of
the Amazon basin and might never have another chance if
not at present, that it would be a good stunt to obtain all
possible information about what route to take, and if feasible
to make another attempt. I spoke about it to Prat
who did not fall in with the idea very well as he had a wholesome
fear of the wild tribes which he was told infested
the whole forest region of Amazonian Peru. After a considerable
palaver he finally agreed to take a chance and
since we were told at the American consulate that the best
way to make the trip would be by the way of the Chanchamayo
and the Perene Rivers, we determined upon this
last-mentioned route and then started to make preparations.
</p>

<p>
There lives in Lima one of the best fellows that I have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_473' name='Page_473'>[473]</a></span>
ever become a chance acquaintance of. His name is Tomas
de Mandalangoitia and by occupation he is an official of the
Peruvian line of steamers plying between Ilo and Panama.
He gave me much information about my prospective trip
and as his intentions were to sail the next week for Panama
on business for his company, he offered to see that all
our baggage would get through safely to that port. This
he did, and to him I am extremely thankful as otherwise I
would have never been able to make the trip. I left the
details of the first stages of the trip to Signor Francesco
Sansoni, the courier of the Hotel Maury, who telegraphed
to the different stopping places en route as far as the Perene
Colony, making reservations for me for horses, and accommodation
for me, with guides. He arranged my itinerary
and also made in Lima what necessary purchases we
would require. The latter consisted of a portable stove,
tent, blankets, rifles, revolvers, sack of beans, salt, sugar,
molasses, and buckskin shoes. I also carried a camera
and medicine chest. I might as well mention that I went
to all this expense for nothing because on the Rio Tambo
our boat upset and we lost everything in the water excepting
the clothes we had on, our money which with our letters
of credit we had tied around our persons in a belt, and our
revolvers with a box of cartridges which we had in our
pockets. Prat even lost his hat and was obliged to buy an
Indian piece of headgear from a native boatman which he
wore until we reached Iquitos a month later.</p>

<p class='caption'>Llamas at Casapalca
</p>

<p class="caption-sub">
Casapalca is about 14,000 feet above sea level</p>
</div>

<p>
The railroad to Oroya, the highest in the world, has been
described so many times that it is unnecessary to do so
now. In even hours one is taken from Lima to an altitude
of 15,865 feet and then dropped down 3686 feet to the
junction town of Oroya, from which place a railroad runs
northward to Cerro de Pasco, and another one southward
to Huancayo. At Casapalca near to the summit of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_474' name='Page_474'>[474]</a></span>
Andes west of the divide there was a herd of llamas numbering
about three hundred behind the railroad sheds.
I obtained a good photograph of them which is here
reproduced. Most of the people on the train suffered
from <i>soroche</i>, a mountain sickness akin to vertigo and
nausea which is due to the rapid change in atmosphere
that the traveler undergoes when he is whisked into the
high, nitrogenous altitudes. It commonly takes several
days before the unaccustomed person feels all right again.
At Oroya there is a fair hotel, the Junin, where I was
obliged to stop over night and where the raw air nearly
chilled me through on account of my previous sojourn in
the sub-tropics. Oroya is 12,179 feet above sea level and
is a bleak, dismal place at its best. The wind blows
something fierce and chills one's very marrow. I told Prat
that he had better dress warmly but the Spaniard said that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_475' name='Page_475'>[475]</a></span>
since we were only to endure a few days' frigidity he could
stand it. It was laughable to see him shiver in his Palm
Beach suit and watch him chase his straw sailor hat
which a gust of wind would occasionally blow off. Even
though I was warmly clad, I was obliged to crawl under
four blankets with all my clothes on when I retired that
night.
</p>

<p>
At six o'clock the next morning we were awakened and
upon emerging from the front door found a cholo guide,
who Francesco Sansoni had telegraphed for, awaiting us
with four mules, one for the baggage. We had so much
paraphernalia with us that it would have been impossible
to load it all upon one mule, so I had it divided somewhat
in order that the three mules which we were to ride would
bear some of the burden. We were ready to start out at
any time after breakfast was served, which we had ordered
for 6.30 <span class='s08'>A.M.</span>, but seven o'clock slipped by without any of
the servants having prepared any. I went into the kitchen
and asked the cook to hurry with it, but he said that the
proprietor was asleep and had the keys of the pantry. I
told him to awaken him, but the cholo cook was evidently
afraid to disturb the sleep of his Italian master. It was
nearly nine o'clock before we got away after we had partaken
of some stale rolls and several cups of poor coffee.
For an hour and a half after starting we climbed a broad,
well-traveled path up the western slopes of the barren
mountains, until we reached the summit where there was a
pass at an altitude of 13,975 feet above sea level. This
pass is the dividing line between the Mantaro and the
Palca watersheds, both of which belong to the Amazon
basin. The Mantaro flows in a southeasterly direction out
of Lake Junin and as a creek flows past the towns of Oroya
and Jauja, ever increasing in volume so that it is quite
respectable in size at Huancayo. Beyond the summit was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_476' name='Page_476'>[476]</a></span>
a large uneven plain from which rose many rounded hills
and stony buttes and which was sprinkled here and there
with coarse tufts of bunch grass at which we saw llamas
grazing. These mountain plateaus are in Chile called
pampas, in Bolivia and Southern Peru, <i>punos</i>, but here
and farther north as far as Colombia, <i>paramos</i>. It took
us an hour to cross this plain which sloped gently to the
east; then began a rough descent over stony ground on the
eastern slopes of the mountain till we reached a formation
where a depression of the ground showed us was the beginning
of a valley. The grasses became more abundant and
a few shrubs appeared. The lower we descended, the
more these shrubs took on the appearance of trees so that
now the country had a totally different aspect from the
barrenness of Oroya and the high plateau. The path had
broadened considerably so that it nearly assumed a road-like
width, and we met many droves of llamas followed
up by drivers on muleback. All were carrying merchandise
to the railroad. In a few days they would return
with the products of the civilized world imported from
North America and Europe. We now came upon the
south bank of a fastly flowing stream and followed this
for about five hours, riding very slowly and taking in the
landscape which was becoming less wild all the time. A
few miles before reaching Tarma the banks of the creek were
clothed with patches of calla lilies, growing wild, in their
original native state, the dark green of their arrow-shaped
leaves forming a brilliant color contrast with the creamy
whiteness of their blossoms and the golden yellow of their
petals. A cleft in the mountains was seen ahead, which
showed us that our creek here joined another river, which
was true for here the Acomayo was reached. Presently
the red tile roofs of Tarma were seen among the eucalyptus
groves and soon we clattered down an avenue bordered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' name='Page_477'>[477]</a></span>
by trees and on each side of which ran irrigation
ditches. At the end of this avenue was an ornamental
gate built into the solid walls of the buildings and which
looked like a triumphal arch. Under this we passed and
then entered the narrow streets of the city, drawing up at
the Hotel Roma on the plaza, where rooms reserved for
us by Sansoni were awaiting our occupancy.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i502" id="i502"></a>
<img src="images/i-502.jpg" width="541" height="401" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Tarma, Peru</p>
</div>

<p>
Tarma is a very pleasant town of five thousand inhabitants
in an ideal location in a narrow valley which it seems
to fill at the base of high mountains. Its altitude is 10,010
feet above sea level but it lacks the chill of such highly
situated towns east of the cordillera. Here the cold winds
from the high paramos and ice peaks do not reach owing
to its sheltered position. The air is fresh, but not raw and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_478' name='Page_478'>[478]</a></span>
reminds one of the first breezes of spring. I was told by
the accommodating Italian hotel proprietor that the climate
is that of a perpetual spring.
</p>

<p>
The city is compactly built with one- and two-story
adobe houses, those on the main streets being painted light
colors or whitewashed. In the center of the town is a treeless
plaza but beautified with shrubs in which is a round
cement fountain and an octagonal frame bandstand. At
one side of this plaza is the parish church in charge of an
amiable fat priest, a cholo who has but a slight strain of
white blood as can be observed by his dark, heavy jowled
features. He was clad in a white robe of coarse wool over
which hung a dark cape. He seemed very much interested
in us and gave us letters of introduction to other priests
along the road which we would follow. These he handed
to Prat who accidentally lost them on purpose; the Catalonian
in his heart was an agnostic, and a Roman Catholic
only in his bringing up. He would walk a block out of
his way to avoid meeting a priest, yet when he was sick
would always want to have one about him. He would
never enter a church and would make sacrilegious remarks,
yet when a thunderstorm would come up, he would cross
himself and mumble prayers only to forget them as soon as
the sky became clear again. Padre Troncoso was the
name of the Tarma priest and he delighted in having me
take his photograph. He teaches in the parish school and
asked me to take a picture of his highest class which consisted
of sixteen boys, most of whom were white.
</p>

<p>
The Hotel Roma is a two-story structure with a carved
wooden balcony on its second floor; its exterior is much
like many buildings in Stamboul. It is a very comfortable
and clean place with good food. There is another hotel
in Tarma, the Umberto, which is well spoken of. The
most curious sight in the small city is the cemetery. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_479' name='Page_479'>[479]</a></span>
reminds one of a Chinese burying ground. It is filled with
many grotesque monuments, some of them having tiled
roofs. These individual tombstones are of adobe, and are
whitewashed over. They contain several niches into
which the coffins are placed and they are so narrow that
the gruesome burdens may be put in them at either end.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i504" id="i504"></a>
<img src="images/i-504.jpg" width="542" height="410" alt="" />
<p class='caption'>Cemetery, Tarma</p>
</div>

<p>
We left Tarma early in the morning and followed the
Acomayo River a couple of hours to the town of Acobamba,
a pretty village much resembling Tarma only
smaller. We watered our mules here, tarried about an
hour, and then continued for another two hours to the city
of Palca which is very much like both Tarma and Acobamba,
although smaller than the first-mentioned place
and larger than the last-mentioned one. It is a poorer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' name='Page_480'>[480]</a></span>
place than Tarma, but it has a larger church. This building
is several hundred years old; it is of adobe, and has a
broad façade from one side of which rises a four-story belfry
capped with a steeple. The valley is here very narrow
but beyond Palca there is a widening where the Acomayo
flows into the Rio Palca. This river we followed the rest
of the day. The scenery between Tarma and Palca is
much the same, and is distinguished by the number of
century plants along the roadside and the abundance of
calla lilies along the river bed. Some of these lilies were
spotted and likewise had light spots on their leaves.
Leaving Palca there was a much more varied vegetation.
This was noticeable when we crossed the river and we
proceeded along its south bank. The mountains were
still barren but were beginning to show unmistakable
signs by the increased number of bushes on their slopes
that we were approaching a wetter climate. The river
itself had all the attractions of a clear, rushing mountain
torrent working its way among the rocks and bowlders; its
banks of shale rock were steep and thickly clothed with
vegetable life of many species. Among the latter were
wild verbenas of the brightest scarlet, purple begonias,
several varieties of fern, wild tobacco plants, and a creeper
much like the wild cucumber. An hour beyond Palca
we arrived at the hill of Carpapata down whose sides the
road zigzagged in many windings. The natives have
made a short cut between the zigzags which saves a couple
of kilometers but which is too steep to be descended in
comfort. Up and down this short cut they drive their
llamas which take readily to its steepness like mountain
sheep. Arrived near the bottom of the hill the road leads
along the ledge of a cliff high above the turbulent river.
To look down or up is apt to cause giddiness. This is
the famous scene that is portrayed in the geographies of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_481' name='Page_481'>[481]</a></span>
half a century ago where a llama train is meeting a mule
train on a curve at the side of a precipice. The view
with the river flowing at the bottom of the gorge is truly
impressive. The mountains on either side are sheer and
rocky, their upper slopes covered only with grass, their
bases clothed with shrubs. Straight before us leading to
a veritable land of promise lay the road, threading its way
on a gentle downward grade, perpetually alternating from
the convex to the concave on the ledge of the mountains.
Ahead of us on the other side of the canyon a single mountain
appeared clad with forest trees up to its very summit,
the first that I had seen in Peru. As we drew nearer it
became a scene of enchanting beauty, with its colorings
of light green and gray. From the underbrush near its
summit there was poured forth a large waterfall, which
dashed down its entire height in three separate cascades
for several hundred feet.
</p>

<p>
Towards evening we reached the rest house named the
Huacapistana Hotel, at an exact altitude of 5600 feet
above sea level. This is the real gateway to the tropics.
The hotel, owned by an Italian, is built on a narrow shelf
of land in a flowery meadow above the river and below
the road. It is a clean well-kept two-story building with
half a dozen guests' rooms. Adjoining it and separated
from the meadow by a stone wall is a barn and a corral for
horses and llamas. The climate is fresh but it is much
warmer than at Tarma. A mist gathered over the river
that night which made the atmosphere rather chilly. This
is frequently the case and it does not lift until the sun is
well out the next morning.
</p>

<p>
We got an early start the next day and found the road,
which was now smooth, wet, and slippery from the mist.
The tree trunks and branches were rich in symbiotic life,
with ferns, lianas, and orchidaceous plants of many species.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_482' name='Page_482'>[482]</a></span>
The wild cotton trees were laden with festoons of
roseate blossoms, and from the extremities of their slender
branches would be seen hanging large wasps' nests. Other
nests such as those of bees and ants of a gray color spotted
the rocks or any available bare space on the smooth bark of a
tree. The effect of the giant tree fern spreading its graceful
fronds over the path was enchanting; beneath its shade
grew seemingly every other species of fern which one has
ever noticed in hothouses at home. We passed several
small coffee plantations; in the clearings near the houses
were banana, orange, and papaya trees. The tit-shaped
fruit of the latter is so common that it is left unpicked
for the birds to feed on. The pods attain maturity
in regular sequence from the lowest to the highest, swelling
in size, changing from green to yellow, and becoming
soft and possessing an insipid sweetish odor. In the
matter of vegetation generally, the above description may
be fairly said to characterize the whole region; orchids,
scarlet cannas, the broad-leafed caladium or elephant's
ear, purple, white, and pink begonias, scarlet verbenas;
creepers, ferns, and mosses; forest trees, reeds, grasses,
and plant life generally, interspersed with huge bowlders
and masses of weatherbeaten rock of a chalky whiteness,
all contributing to the formation of the most perfect fairy
scene imaginable.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally one would meet with a blaze of color from
some wild cotton trees, laden with flowers, pink, yellow,
and even blue; and equally striking was the effect of a species
of wild runner bean with dark green leaves and thick
bunches of vermilion flowers hanging in tresses, and appearing
to nearly smother the tree which gave it support.
</p>

<p>
The road made a sudden double turn to reach a lower
level by the side of the river, and then became a low-roofed
passage cut beneath an immense wall of overhanging rock,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_483' name='Page_483'>[483]</a></span>
open and unsupported on the river side, and in plain view
of the turbulent stream below. The softest and most
luxuriant vegetation covers this rock, and it is overhung in
many places with the graceful tape fern, and the snakelike
roots of trees. Here I saw a large toucan fly across the
ravine and its brilliant plumage of scarlet and black added
a still further charm to the scene. The next view after
passing beneath the rocky projection is one which can
never fail to arrest the attention. At a distance ahead,
sufficient to enable one to take in the whole picture, rises
the Pan de Azucar (Sugar Loaf), a mountain in the middle
of the now broadened river bed. Its marvelous shape
and mantle of green forest trees, which extend to its summit,
remind one of the Pitons at Castries, St. Lucia,
although on a much smaller scale. We came to a place
where there used to be a swinging bridge but which was
some time ago abandoned because the road crosses the
river by a new stone one farther down. Here on turning
around in our saddles is a view different in character but
equally impressive and grand. This is a great perpendicular
patch of white rock regularly stratified but wrinkled
and most strangely contorted into the form of an elliptical
curve.
</p>

<p>
The bridges over the river which we had to cross at
different stages of the journey deserve a word of praise
for their construction, combining lightness with strength.
They are of the suspension type, built of strong cables
with plank footboards, and sufficient to meet the needs
of the present light and limited mule traffic. When crossing,
it is advisable to dismount and walk, because they
sway considerably and are open at the sides. One such
bridge some twelve miles below Huacapistana leads to
the hacienda of Naranjal, a sugar plantation. The only
bridge that I know of in North America similar to these
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_484' name='Page_484'>[484]</a></span>
swinging bridges of Peru spans Capilano Canyon near
North Vancouver, in British Columbia. Naranjal has an
old-fashioned garden with a fountain surrounded with
mango and orange trees, the latter giving the name to the
place. Three miles below Naranjal is the ranch house of
Milagro, belonging to a man named Horquiera.
</p>

<p>
San Ramon is a little village situated in the heart of the
Chanchamayo district. The country is here more open
and is surrounded at varying distances by undulations and
rounded hills, thickly covered with virgin forest; their
lower slopes were, however, cleared for sugar, coffee, and
cocoa plantations. After the mist had cleared in the early
morning, the day had been hot, but full of novel interest,
and although we had made an early start we had progressed
at a speed not exceeding three miles an hour and
had now only completed fifteen miles. The settlement
of San Ramon although somewhat scattered consists
chiefly of one street, the houses on which are no more
than huts. They are built of wood and have thatched
roofs, the latter slanting downward in front from the
ridge of the pole. The hotel is the only substantial building
of the village. It is a two-story stone and adobe
building set back from the road in a field which is somewhat
overrun with castor beans.
</p>

<p>
The six miles between San Ramon and La Merced was
over fairly level ground and through less imposing scenery.
On the way we passed through several hamlets inhabited
by Chinamen and cholos, and small <i>chacras</i> on which
grew papayas and other fruits. All the buildings were
of mud or cane, thatched and of that rustic and simple
character which not only harmonizes with a natural
environment, but suits the country and climate and seems
in every way to meet the needs of a primitive population.
Over the door of one such edifice was the sign
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_485' name='Page_485'>[485]</a></span>
which denoted that it was used as a school. At the time
of our passing, the only scholars visible were a boy and a
girl, who with their backs to the open door, sat at a desk
gazing at a monstrous colored diagram demonstrating
the evil effects of alcohol upon the human system. We
crossed the very fine Herreria suspension bridge and two
hours after leaving San Ramon entered La Merced.
</p>

<p>
La Merced is situated on a flat-topped eminence and
commands a good view of the surrounding country, but in
itself it does not seem to possess any characteristics of
special interest. It is merely a small country town with
typical parish church and plaza and is in telegraphic communication
with the outside world. The inhabitants of
the town have suffered considerably from malaria which is
visible on their wasted and parchment-colored countenances.
Leaving La Merced it took us three hours to
reach the Peruvian Corporation's headquarters. This is
located at the junction of the rivers Paucartambo and
Chanchamayo, the combined river taking the name of
Perené. The road, which was fair, wound around the left
bank of the Chanchamayo, now a river of considerable
breadth, and the scenery once more became increasingly
beautiful. Tree ferns and tree palms of different kinds
were again abundant; from one of these species, fanlike in
leaf, is made the local straw hat, but little inferior to the
so-called Panama variety. Butterflies, both large and
small, were omnipresent. The whole distance from La
Merced to the Peruvian Corporation's headquarters is
about fifteen miles. The bridge over the Colorado River,
a tributary stream, was under repair, so leaving the path
we saved time and distance by fording it. In the rainy
season this would have been an impossibility, for it becomes
a raging torrent, as evidenced by the huge rounded
boulders, and width of its bed, along which we had to ride.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_486' name='Page_486'>[486]</a></span>
This part, bordered by tall reeds, towering above our heads,
was now dry and led us to another arm of the river, where
a fairly strong flow of water wet our mules up to their
bellies. Regaining our path, we eventually regained the
Paucartambo, which we crossed by the means of a primitive
log raft, while the guide took the mules across by a
bridge a mile down the river.
</p>

<p>
Here among the clean-washed stones of the river bed, I
got my first view of the uncivilized Indian. This was a
male Chuncho native, rifle in hand, returning from an
unsuccessful hunt. At first he hid behind some brushwood
but was finally induced to come out. He was a well-built,
sturdy fellow of medium height, attired in a loose brown
robe of native manufacture. His skin was of the same hue,
and his head of thick black hair was encircled and held in
place by a plain band of cane. Sunday is a market day at
the Peruvian Corporation's camp; it was then that I saw
more of these Indians. From them I obtained for a few
centavos several of their chains of colored seeds, and
monkey teeth, and ultimately procured a complete outfit,
headband, more aboriginal ornamental finery, parrots'
wings with feathers attached which serve as a loin cloth,
bows and arrows. They are painted with a facial adornment
of vermilion, with the occasional addition of grease to
keep the flies and insects off. This red paint is found
ready made in the seeds of the achote, a bush of two varieties
which produces maroon-colored pods and which
grows wild in the chacra clearings. These Indians who
live in the neighborhood of the settlements are mild,
peaceful, and intelligent, skilled in domestic industries
which is the manufacture of bows and arrows. They are
excellent marksmen. They are somewhat small in stature
but well built. They take readily to the water and learn
to swim, and are cleaner in their habits and customs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_487' name='Page_487'>[487]</a></span>
than the cholos and mountain Indians. Filial affection
is a not deeply implanted instinct with them, and among
them human life is but lightly esteemed. While few
serious crimes are committed among them, murder is
accounted as nothing. If a widow with a young family
remarries, it is the all but universal practice for the second
husband to kill her children by a previous marriage. It is
also a common occurrence for a family to throw their parents
into the river when, through the infirmity of advancing
years, life becomes a burden, either to themselves, or
to those on whom they should look for support. The
manager of the Peruvian Corporation's headquarters told
me that on one occasion he had the greatest difficulty in
restraining some Chunchos from throwing into the Perené,
a man who was suffering from a bad abscess, and who was
eventually cured by having it lanced. This is the fate
they mete out to all members of their tribe who are suffering
from diseases which they consider incurable.
</p>

<p>
Eighty miles below the camp, where the rivers Perené
and Ené unite to form the Tambo, dwell a colony of Campas
Indians known as the Ungoninos. Owing to the
outrages perpetrated upon them by the rubber gatherers,
they offer a stout resistance to the approach of a stranger,
for they have learned not to trust the white man. Though
they are not cannibals, it is impossible to enter their
territory, and in making the cross-country journey to
Iquitos, it is necessary to go by the way of Puerto Jessup
and Puerto Bermudez if one wishes to escape with one's
life. The Cashibos, on the other hand, are a distinct race
of Indians who inhabit the plains on the left bank of
the Pachitea. They are cannibals. These people wear no
clothes, shave their heads, and wage continual warfare on
all the surrounding tribes. Their cannibalistic propensities
have been explained in the attempt on the part of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_488' name='Page_488'>[488]</a></span>
the Cashibo to absorb into his system qualities of the white
man which he considers to be superior to his own. They,
like other tribes, have undoubtedly been made worse by the
shocking treatment they have received at the hands of the
caucheros (rubber gatherers), some of whom are the lawless
descendants of European immigrants whose ostensible occupation
is the gathering of rubber, but who, at the same
time, carry on a lucrative trade in the sale of human beings.
From what I have heard, there prevails a state of affairs
which in its recorded and unrecorded atrocities, falls nothing
short of the darkest page of slavery practiced in the
days of Leopold II. in Belgian Congo. The Cashibos have
been a fierce and warlike tribe; now they have learned what
the crack of the carbine means and quickly get out of the
way when they hear it. They are, however, very treacherous,
and a small party traveling through their country
would run a great risk of serving as a banquet for them.
They kill off all the men of the other tribes down the
Ucayali and sell the women and children whenever they
can get a market for them. The method may not be
humanitarian but it is at least practical and remunerative
to them.
</p>

<p>
Coffee does not grow at the Peruvian Corporation's
headquarters camp but at a half-dozen different chacras
some distance from it. This plan was adopted to obviate
the possible exigencies of blight, but it is an unfortunate
one, because not only does it augment the difficulties of
transport but militates against anything like direct personal
supervision. These haciendas, which produce the
most excellent coffee and cocoa, are known as La Magdalena,
La Margarita, and San Juan. These are the
largest and most important as well as being the farthest
away. The difficulties of intercommunication are increased
by the character of the roads which in the rainy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_489' name='Page_489'>[489]</a></span>
season are nearly impassable on account of the mud. The
road to La Magdalena needs constant clearing to prevent
it from becoming an overgrown track; those leading to
La Margarita and to San Juan are toilsome zigzagging
ascents which after heavy rains furnish stretches of mire
and clay knee deep. In addition to this, streams cross
the road in many places, and when swollen frequently
wash it entirely away. All the haciendas are in the
Perené division of the country, bounded on the south by
the main river and on the west separated from the Chanchamayo
region by the Paucartambo. From here eastward
stretches two hundred miles of hilly land before the general
level of the Brazilian plains is reached, and the whole is
covered with a dense forest, uninhabited excepting by wild
Indians. It is a wonderful country, stored with natural
wealth and capable of immense development when it will
be opened up. Its climate and general conditions are,
with the exception of malaria and blackwater fever,
healthy, and there are but few drawbacks in the way of
insect pests.
</p>

<p>
For four solid days, after arriving at the headquarters'
camp, it rained, which kept us indoors or near the shelter
of the buildings. The fifth day broke cloudless with the
sun shining, and as we had spent enough time loafing about
the buildings of the Peruvian Corporation, we decided to
start out, and try to make the mission station of Jesus
Maria at the junction of the Perené and the Pangoa Rivers
in three days' time. From there we could hire some
natives to take us in a canoe in three more days to Puerto
Raimondi, a settlement on the Ucayali River at which
place we thought it would be possible to board a steam
launch to take us down the stream to Iquitos. We later on
discovered that we were wrong because we had to canoe
down the Ucayali as far as Cumaria a distance of one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_490' name='Page_490'>[490]</a></span>
hundred miles below Puerto Raimondi. The trail down
the Perené lay through level country, the mountains having
somewhat receded from the river. Sometimes a spur
would extend to the banks, but after the first day out they
were for the most part several miles off to the north.
They were diminishing in height, and those to the north
were called the Cerros de la Sal. The guide that had
come with us from Oroya returned home from the Perené
Colony, but the manager at headquarters' camp, Señor
Villalta, provided us with horses, and sent along with us
as far as Jesus Maria, a half-breed and two native Indians.
He did this because these Indians belonged to the tribe
that lives beyond Jesus Maria, and through them we would
be able to continue our journey in safety since they would
procure for us at the mission station an escort which would
see us through to the place where we were to board the
launch. There were quite a few small chacras on the first
two days' trip and both nights we managed to find lodging
at one of them. The first night out, I noticed that the bag
of Ica beans and most of the canned stuff which Sansoni
had bought for us in Lima was missing. I spoke to Prat
about this because he had carried the sack of beans with
him on his mount. He professed surprise and gave out
his theory that the cholo guide from Oroya had stolen
them and had gone back home with them. I had my
doubts about this because the Spaniard had been complaining
a dozen times every day about the load that he
had to lug along with him. I said nothing about it until
five weeks later when we were in the hotel in Manaos
awaiting a Brazilian Lloyd steamer to take us to Para.
Prat was in the barroom slightly under the influence of
vermouth and bitters, relating to Colonel Constantino
Nery, governor of the State of Amazonas, our adventures
in crossing the continent. The governor asked him how
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_491' name='Page_491'>[491]</a></span>
we had fared for food, to which Prat answered that we
had done well considering that we were obliged to eat
Indian concoctions that the ordinary white man would not
sniff at. I added that we might have lived better if Prat
had not left behind at the Perené Colony the sack of beans
and the canned goods. The latter then went on to relate
that the cholo guide from Oroya stole them. I interrupted
saying that since the trip was now over and we had reached
civilization safely that it did not matter what had become
of them, but that I believed Prat had left them behind
because he did not want to be bothered with them. The
Spaniard called for another vermouth and then laughingly
owned up that he had left them behind saying that the
temperature was hot enough the way it was without
being hampered with any burdens. Nery told him that
he was quite right and that he would have done the same
had he been there. This trick of leaving our provisions
behind has always since appealed to Prat as a huge joke.
</p>

<p>
Our water trip from Jesus Maria to Para, thence to
Cayenne, Paramaribo, Georgetown, Bridgetown, Willemstedt,
and to Colon is full of enough material to fill another
book which will appear in the near future. This book is
only meant to deal with the southern countries of South
America such as Chile, Argentina, and Paraguay. I have
added to it a few chapters not dealing on the original
subject, but which I refrained from leaving out as they were
a series of consecutive travel. At Jesus Maria we hired a
canoe which took us down the Rio Tambo to Puerto Raimondi
which is situated on the west bank of that stream
at its junction with the Urubamba which here forms the
Ucayali. Behind us inland was the Cashobi country so in
continuing our canoe trip to Cumaria we always camped
on the right bank of the river. It took us one week of stiff
paddling to reach Cumaria. One day our canoe capsized,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_492' name='Page_492'>[492]</a></span>
making us lose everything we had with us, necessitating us
to partake of such delicacies as stewed monkey and parrot
which the Indian stomach craves for and which are nearly
always to be purchased at the Indian encampments on the
right bank of the Ucayali. Cumaria is the head of river
navigation. It is an Indian settlement at which a few <i>caucheros</i>,
or rubber gatherers, live. Here we were fortunate
enough to become passengers of a gasoline launch which
took us in a week to Contamana. We had been told at
Jesus Maria that the launches were steam power, but were
surprised when we arrived at Cumaria to find that they were
gasoline ones, and this in the wilderness, many hundred
miles from civilization. At Contamana we changed into
another gasoline launch. Here we entered that part of
the river which is called the Bajo or Lower Ucayali. It
differs much from the Alto or Upper Ucayali in so far that
the distant mountains have altogether disappeared, the
stream is much broader, has many channels, and is filled
with large islands some of them being fifty miles long.
Also settlements are more plentiful, and at the docks near
the hamlets crude rubber in balls is waiting for exportation.
Two days before reaching Iquitos the Bajo Ucayali is
joined by the Maranon and the Amazon itself is entered.
</p>

<p>
Iquitos is a fever-stricken port of twelve thousand
inhabitants on the left bank of the Amazon. It is built on
the high banks above the river opposite to some islands of
the same name, and not far above the confluence of the
Nanay and the Amazon. Above the town is a fair-sized
stream, the Itaya, which makes the city located on a
peninsula. It is the capital of the Province of Loreto,
which comprises the entire Peruvian Amazonian lowlands,
and has a wireless telegraph communication with Puerto
Bermudez (which is only a three days' trip from the
Perené Colony). From Puerto Bermudez telegraph wires
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_493' name='Page_493'>[493]</a></span>
run to Lima via La Merced. Iquitos is the center of the
rubber industry of the Upper Amazon and is a booming
town in spite of the yellow fever which is nearly always
prevalent. It has steamship communication with Manaos,
Para, and the outside world.
</p>

<p>
Up to a decade ago, if a man in Lima had business in
Iquitos, he was obliged to take a steamer to England,
tranship to Para, and there tranship again to Iquitos. He
had the alternative of going to Panama, across the isthmus
to Colon and thence take a steamer to Barbadoes. From
Barbadoes he would go to Para, and thence to Iquitos.
These were long trips, several months being endured in
the passage. Now Iquitos is reached across country from
Lima; the trip takes anywhere from three weeks to six
months, according to which route the traveler chooses.
It has been done in sixteen days, but from four to five
weeks is the average allowing time for misconnections.
I believe that the shortest way to reach Iquitos from Lima
is to take a steamer to Pacasmayo, which is a day and a
half north of the capital. Thence go by rail and horseback
to Cajamarca. From there go by horseback via
Chachapoyas to Moyobamba. From Moyobamba one
can go in two to three days to Yurimaguas on the Huallaga
River, whence one can go by launch to Iquitos in a week
and a half. I know a person who went from Cerro de
Pasco to Iquitos. He followed the Huallaga to its mouth
and it took him six months. The common way of reaching
Iquitos from Lima is to go to La Merced; thence overland
through Puerto Bermudez to Puerto Victoria on the
Sampoya River down which one descends on a canoe to
the Ucayali, taking a chance of making connection with
the launch at Santa Rosa de los Canivos, which is about
one third of the way downstream between Cumaria and
Contamana. There is also a northern route which takes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_494' name='Page_494'>[494]</a></span>
about five weeks. The eastbound traveler goes from
Paita to Piura by rail; thence via Huancabamba to Jaen
by horseback. Jaen is a day's stage from the Maranon
which one must descend by canoe.
</p>

<p>
In the night after the day on which the steamer left
Iquitos, the Napo River was passed. It flows into the
Amazon from a northwesterly direction. One of its
tributaries is the Curaray which rises in the Andes of
Ecuador. Along its course live a tribe of head-hunting
Indians. These savages after they capture a white man
or an Indian of another tribe, behead them. They boil
the head in a concoction which loosens the bones. These
they take out and fill the cavity with hot stones. By
some process of their own, they shrink the head until it
becomes no larger than a large orange, yet retaining the
features that the victim possessed during life. These
they offer for sale, and are to be purchased in the curiosity
shops of Lima and Guayaquil on the Pacific Coast, and
even in Para at the mouth of the Amazon. From the
savage to the curiosity shop proprietor they pass through
many hands so that it is impossible to arrive at the source
of the murder. A certain Swede once left Guayaquil for
the interior on an exploring expedition. A year afterwards
a head was purchased in that city which was found to be
that of the Scandinavian. Since he was never heard of
after he crossed the Cordillera, it is assumed that his party
was beset by savages and he was murdered, his skull
boiled down, and hawked about until it reached the hands
of a Guayaquil dealer. The September, 1918, number of
the <i>South American Magazine</i> published in New York,
has an article which says that there is believed to be a
head factory in Guayaquil. The dealer in this sketch is
undoubtedly in league with body-snatchers who supply
him with corpses, which he beheads and boils down, having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_495' name='Page_495'>[495]</a></span>
obtained the recipe from the Indians. These heads
he places on sale. One of his relics was the head of an
employee of the Quito-Guayaquil Railroad who had died
the previous year of yellow fever in Guayaquil and was
supposed to have been given a decent funeral. This
horrid trick of the Indians cannot be eradicated until the
law puts a stop to the purchase of these heads. By
punishing the dealers and the middle-men, the Indians
will cease to find a market for these gruesome souvenirs.

<h2>
CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="s08">BUSINESS PROSPECTS IN ARGENTINA, PARAGUAY, AND
CHILE</span>
</h2>

<p>
The object of these travels was not to see the country
dealt with as much as it was to study the business conditions
and future possibilities in those lines in Chile, Argentina,
and Paraguay.
</p>

<p>
Although there are undoubtedly great opportunities at
the present time and in the future to enter into business
enterprises in the northern republics of South America,
which as yet, only have their surface towards development,
the republics farther south which are partially
developed, offer better inducements owing to their forms of
government, the character of the races who inhabit them,
and the incentives which are offered to the foreigner who
wishes to start a new industry. With the exception of
Argentina and Uruguay there is practically no manufacturing
done on a large scale, such as we are accustomed
to see on all sides in the United States and in Europe.
There are many small industries employing from three to
twenty men, providing the employers with not much more
than a good living, and the employees with a mere subsistence,
but there are no really large ones which are a
credit to their country.
</p>

<p>
To start anything in any of these countries, the matter
of prime importance is for the proprietor and his foreign
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_497' name='Page_497'>[497]</a></span>
employees to be able to converse fluently, read, and write
in Spanish. Next he should understand the character of
the Latin races which is not at all easy if he is prejudiced.
Their ways of doing business are totally different from ours.
Also owing to the scarcity of money in some of these
republics, the new firm should have plenty of ready capital,
and should never organize with a limited amount, the
outstanding balance being made up of notes. To sell preferred
stock to the natives would be nearly impossible,
because no Latin would buy any unless he is "shown"
first, and this "showing" would have to cover a period of a
great many years, so susceptible are they of making investments.
The company should be entirely capitalized with
the cash paid in before the first stroke of business is begun.
Many firms in South America have come to grief by being
only partially capitalized, and their example is always
before the native mind. Competing trusts and grafting
politicians should be reckoned with. Many large firms
give as a present to the governor of a province, or to the
deputy in congress, a few shares of their stock. These
men in turn make laws which benefit their company, and
make it impossible for competitors to transact a legitimate
business.
</p>

<p>
As Argentina offers less opportunities in the manufacturing
line than its neighboring sister republics, it is
best to deal with it first. To begin with, the country is
a great expanse of land, for the most part in appearance a
level plain, gradually rising as one travels westward.
This rise is but two feet to the mile and is imperceptible.
This plain is traversed by quite a few rivers, but so
slowly does the land rise, that these streams are nothing
more than sluggish watercourses, muddy, and affording
no drainage. They often overflow their banks, forming
muddy ponds and lakes a few inches deep. On account of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_498' name='Page_498'>[498]</a></span>
the slowness of their flow they are valueless for waterpower.
This part of the country is therefore not adaptable for
factories; its sole use is for the growing of grain and stock-raising.
Although this is one of the greatest wheat belts
in the world, it has no flour mills, and but few grain elevators.
The wheat is shipped a long distance by rail to
the seaport towns, whence it is exported to Europe. That
which is needed for local consumption is ground into flour
in the seaports which have mills; much of it is shipped back
over the same road that it went out on to be distributed
over the sections where the grain was grown. The towns
here are small and far apart. Their only excuse for an
existence is that they are the distributing points for an
agricultural section and to them the necessities of life are
shipped which eventually find their way to the large estancias
as the farms are called. To these towns grain is hauled
to be shipped out by the railroad. Stores spring up, a
hotel or two is built, a few professional men such as doctors
and lawyers establish themselves, but nobody ever
thinks of starting a factory. It would be folly to do so,
because there is no future besides agriculture and stock.
There is no fuel, no iron, and no waterpower.
</p>

<p>
West of the great Argentine plain we reach the mountains.
The Andes here are the highest peaks in all America.
They rise abruptly from the plain like a barrier and have no
foothills. There are but few rivers in this section, and
those which do exist are swiftly flowing, turbulent streams.
They can furnish waterpower and some of them do for
electricity. Yet there are no factories. It is again the
question of the scarcity of fuel. So poor is Argentina in
her fuel supply that most of the locomotives burn wood.
The coal used for those which run in the eastern provinces
is imported from Europe and the United States. Oil
fields have been opened in Patagonia with a view of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_499' name='Page_499'>[499]</a></span>
decreasing the price of fuel, but as yet they are in the
embryo stage. It is not known whether they will ever be
made an economic asset, because the quality of the oil is
said to be poor. The country at the foot of the Andes
near the latitudinal center of Argentina which is watered
by the mountain streams is called the Zona del Riego. It
is here that are located the extensive vineyards and fruit
orchards. There are three separate belts each of which is
fed by its own river. The two southernmost of these are
in the Province of Mendoza, at San Rafael and Mendoza
respectively, while the northern one, is at San Juan in the
province of the same name. Factories which do not
require an excessive amount of fuel could be started, but
nobody has ever turned over their hands in that direction
excepting in fruit-canning plants, which have not paid well.
</p>

<p>
In the city of Mendoza a flour mill could be made to
pay. There are immense flour mills in Argentina, but
with the exception of a few small ones of no importance
and the large one of the Minetti Brothers at Córdoba, all
are located on the seaboard. The Molino del Rio de la
Plata at Buenos Aires has a capital of $14,945,000. It is
the largest in South America. Nearly as large are two
flour mills in Bahia Blanca; Rosario also has a couple of
large mills. For a quarter of a million dollars a flour mill
could be established at Mendoza, which the manager
of the Molino del Rio de la Plata, told me would pay forty
per cent. on the capital from the start, and which would be
dependent on no other trade than that of the city of
Mendoza. At San Juan, one hundred miles north of
Mendoza, there is a small flour mill which is a lucrative
investment. The beauty of having a mill in Mendoza is
the fact that the wheat grown there, although inferior to
that which is grown on the plains on account of its having
to be irrigated, runs forty bushels to the acre and would be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_500' name='Page_500'>[500]</a></span>
in close proximity to the mill, thereby saving freight.
People in the Province of Mendoza who grow wheat ship
their product to Buenos Aires where it is ground. The
flour is then shipped back seven hundred miles to Mendoza
where it sells for a high price, the freight rate being enormous.
Tucumán is a city of over one hundred thousand
inhabitants but has no flour mill worthy of the name.
One would pay in that city but it would require much more
capital both on account of the size of the city and its
distance from the wheat fields. Mercedes, Bragado, Olavarría,
Junin, and many other towns of their size (twenty thousand
population and upwards) could all support flour mills.
They have none and are in the heart of the grain belt.
Wood would have to be used for fuel which would be
expensive, but the profits derived from the flour would offset
it. Pergamino is a growing town in the grain belt
between Buenos Aires and Rosario, with good railroad
facilities, yet it has not a single manufacturing enterprise.
It has a population of forty-three thousand inhabitants.
Personally I think that the flour mill proposition would be
the best paying enterprise in Argentina. It would pay at
all times, war or no war.

One of the leading manufacturing industries in Argentina
is that of the beef-canning factories, here called saladerias.
This is the chief industry of Uruguay, and the
second in importance in Paraguay, and the state of Matto
Grosso, Brazil. These saladerias not only can beef, but
they manufacture beef extract, tallow, and the by-products
of the hides and fat. They likewise ship cold-storage
beef to Europe and even to the United States. The River
Plate basin is where these factories are situated, and in no
other parts of South America are they to be found. Armour
&amp; Company, and Swift have large ones at La Plata.
At Fray Bentos, in Uruguay, on the Uruguay River a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_501' name='Page_501'>[501]</a></span>
short distance above where it flows into the River Plate is
the great establishment and headquarters of the Liebig
Company, the largest of its kind in South America and
one of the largest in the world. There are beef-canning
plants at Montevideo, at Colon, Argentina, and at many
of the ports on the Uruguay, Paraná, and Paraguay
Rivers. These plants require much capital, especially
in Argentina, because here the river is at quite a distance
from the stock country, necessitating the shipment of
cattle by rail. It would be prohibitory as far as expense
goes to establish a beef-canning enterprise inland; by having
them at the seaports, ocean-going freighters can anchor
at the docks and be loaded there. This is true about many
of the river ports owing to the depth of the water which
permits ocean steamers to reach them. None of the
Argentina and Uruguayan saladerias are far enough up the
rivers to be beyond ocean navigation. The Uruguayan
plants have it on those of Argentina, because the stock
country of the former republic lies directly behind the
saladerias and is contingent to the river. In Argentina
the stock have to be transported to the seaboard upwards
of one hundred miles, and in most cases from two to four
hundred miles.
</p>

<p>
Regarding stock-raising, it is done in Argentina on a
large scale. The large estancias are owned by people who
have inherited their lands through several generations and
have in the past decades accumulated great fortunes
which have been sufficient to well stock their estates with
cattle, sheep, and other live stock. The stock roam the
prairies the year around, are not winter fed, and require
but little care. As many of these estancias are forty
miles square, the only expense incurred are the wages of
the herders. Land is held high in Argentina, from $15 an
acre upwards in the stock country, the average being $35
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_502' name='Page_502'>[502]</a></span>
an acre. It would require much capital to buy enough of it
for a fair-sized ranch. Fifteen hundred acres would cost
$45,000. If he put 1000 head of stock on it, which would
be a small ranch, his outlay for the investment would be
about $90,000. A drought would be likely to occur and he
would be up against it. The man, however, who has a
50,000-acre ranch could make money. He could have
10,000 head of cattle and if there was a drought he could
keep moving them about. Twenty thousand acres is but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_503' name='Page_503'>[503]</a></span>
a medium-sized ranch in Argentina and Uruguay. It is
not uncommon for a man to have 100,000 acres, while in
Patagonia there are ranches of 1,000,000 acres. Stock-raising
is the most important industry in Argentina, but
the men who have made a success of it and those at present
engaged in it, started this business years ago. Excepting
in the Province of Salta, it is well for a company or an
individual to keep out of this line of business unless he has
enough money to buy a large tract of land. The figures
here are the average for estancias contiguous to the
average plains towns.

The Province of Salta is about one thousand miles from
Buenos Aires and the seaport towns. On account of its
distance and nature of its land it has nothing in common
with the provinces farther south. It is a hilly and mountainous
region bordering on the tropics abounding in forests
which have a thick matting of grasses. The cattle
are large and lean, and although their beef is rather tough,
there is plenty of it, and there is but little shrinkage in
transportation. The market for this stock is the nitrate
region of Chile. The cattle are driven across the Andes
and lose but little weight on the way. In Antofagasta they
bring a good price. There are no large ranches in the province
and there is not much capital. Here a man with
moderate means could raise stock at a profit, if he dealt
only with the Chilean market. If he shipped them to the
saladerias in the Province of Buenos Aires he would lose
money on account of the freight.
</p>

<p>
An embryo industry in Argentina is that of tannin or
tannic acid, used for dyeing and tanning. The northern
part of the provinces of Santiago del Estero and Santa Fé,
and the greater part of the territories of Formosa and
the Chaco, are covered with a forest of small trees, named
<i>quebracho</i>. They are too small for saw logs, their wood is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_504' name='Page_504'>[504]</a></span>
hard and is used for fuel on the railroads, and they have
a reddish bark. This bark before the European War was
shipped to Germany in great quantities where its extract
was used in dye stuffs. Unfortunately but little of it was
exported to other countries. Some tannin factories were
inaugurated in the Province of Santa Fé, but those controlled
by foreign capital went haywire. This was due
mainly to grafting provincial officials who put these companies
out of commission by their annoyances. A tannin
factory would pay in Argentina if the government would
give it protection. It is a deplorable fact that in many new
industries in Argentina, they are induced to locate there.
Once established, the manufacturer is subjected to a burdening
taxation from the federal government, the province,
and the district. There is a continuous drain of contributions
which have to be handed to congressmen, and their
henchmen; titles are found to be imperfect; law suits are
started; the outcome is that the company is apt to go into
insolvency. This once happened to a large tannin factory
that started in the Province of Santa Fé. A Buenos Aires
bank loaned them money; but the owners ran up against so
many snags when they started to operate, that they were
unable to pay their indebtedness and the bank had to foreclose.
It would be a different story if the company was
Argentine owned. The Argentino from the highest to the
lowest looks upon the North American as a person to exploit
from. They welcome him mainly to relieve him of his
money. When we talk about grafting in our American cities
we do not know what grafting is; one must come to Latin
America to get the interpretation. George W. Crichfield in
his two volumes, <i>American Supremacy</i> (Brentano's 1908),
gives the true version. He says that our best diplomats
are to the South American ones in comparison as what
jackasses are to foxes. This is particularly true about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_505' name='Page_505'>[505]</a></span>
Argentina and could apply to the grafting officials as well.
Although under proper government protection, a tannin
factory in Argentina would pay, it would be useless to wait
for that protection to come, and the manufacturer would be
far better off if he would start his factory in poor, benighted
Paraguay where the grafting would be much less
than in Argentina.
</p>

<p>
In Argentina there is no such thing as prohibition and
local option, and there probably never will be. Such issues
are not in common with the Latin make-up, and the
long-haired stump orators and hypocrites who advocate
this question in the United States for their own personal
enrichment, would undoubtedly land in insane asylums
if they started this propaganda anywhere in South America.
One might think it strange that there is no whiskey
distillery there, yet such is the fact, and I do not know of
any in entire South America. Whiskey is not consumed
there in anywhere near the quantity that it is consumed
in the United States and Great Britain, yet enough is
indulged in by the higher stratum of society who ape the
North Americans and the British to warrant the establishment
of one. There is plenty of grain and there is no competition.
There are several liqueur factories which seem to
pay, one of which at Buenos Aires puts out a cordial named
Aperital, which has a great sale.
</p>

<p>
There are thirteen breweries in the republic, but lest a
person should think of starting another one, he should
forget the idea at the same time that he conceives it.
There is a brewery trust heavily capitalized, composed of
Argentine and British stockholders. Much of this stock is
in the hands of senators and congressmen, who see to it
that laws are made which protect them and work to the
detriment of their competitors. The Argentine Brewing
Company at Quilmes, a suburb of Buenos Aires, heads
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_506' name='Page_506'>[506]</a></span>
this trust, the other members of which are the Bieckert
Brewing Company at Llavallol, another suburb of Buenos
Aires, the Palermo Brewery at Buenos Aires, the San
Carlos Brewery at San Carlos, and the Del Norte Brewery
at Tucumán. Those not belonging to the trust are the
Córdoba Brewing Company at Córdoba, the Rio Segundo
Brewing Company with breweries both at Córdoba and at
Rio Segundo, the Ahrens Brewery at Córdoba, the Santa
Fé Brewing Company at Santa Fé, the Schlau and the
Germania Brewery at Rosario, and the Correntino Brewery
at Corrientes. Both the Ahrens and the Correntino
breweries are small establishments and only cater to local
and family trade and therefore have not fell foul of the
trust.
</p>

<p>
Since much beer is drunk in Argentina I have often
wondered why there were no more breweries. I wondered
why Mendoza, Salta, Bahia Blanca, Mercedes, Pergamino,
Paraná, Concordia, and other towns did not have any.
I mentioned this fact to the mayor of Salta. "It would
not pay," said he. "An old German named Glueck once
had a brewery in this town, whose product took well
with the public. His was a small brewery with limited
capital. The Quilmes Company, through their representatives
in congress, had taxes formulated so that only those
breweries with much capital could stand up under them.
Glueck had to go out of business. The trust then built the
Del Norte Brewery in Tucumán which is so large that if all
the other breweries in Argentina should shut down, it
could supply the whole republic with beer. The trust
also bought a piece of property in Salta and threaten if
another brewery starts up in this city to put up one that
will swamp it. The trust has millions of pesos capital, so
what can one do?"
</p>

<p>
While in Córdoba I was a guest of Mr. Douglas, president
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_507' name='Page_507'>[507]</a></span>
of the Rio Segundo Brewing Company. This company
started a brewery on a small scale at the town of Rio
Segundo, hence the name. The water used for the manufacture
of its beer came from an artesian well, and the
product was so superior to that of the other breweries that
it was necessary to build another brewery, which was done
at Córdoba, twenty-three miles away. The water in this is
also artesian. The output of the Rio Segundo Brewery at
Córdoba is only sixty thousand barrels a year, but it is
taxed more than those whose output is six hundred thousand
barrels in the United States. It has kept its head
above water on account of the quality of the beer. A
former brewmaster of this company started a small brewery
in Corrientes, the Correntino, but this like that of
Ahrens at Córdoba have not been molested by the trust
because they are too small to interfere with the business of
the Quilmes Company. With the exception of the output
of the Rio Segundo breweries, all the Argentine beer is vile
and not fit to drink. Hops are difficult to get, and injurious
chemicals are used for its preservation.
</p>

<p>
Two automobile factories have been started in Buenos
Aires but their existence was of but a short duration.
The parts were shipped there to be assembled, but the
stockholders thought that it would be more lucrative if
they manufactured their own parts. Since there is no
iron in the republic, it was found that its importation was
too expensive to allow the companies to ship it in, therefore
they went out of business.
</p>

<p>
Hides are not expensive. There are many small so-called
shoe factories which in reality are but shops; the
shoes manufactured in them are good and cheap, and are
made by hand. They likewise have class, and a shoeman
from Toronto told me that the shoes manufactured there
were superior to ours, and the United States has the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_508' name='Page_508'>[508]</a></span>
reputation of making the best shoes in the world. This
Canadian said that he could see no reason why a fair-sized
shoe factory would not pay in Buenos Aires and was very
optimistic about the idea.
</p>

<p>
In the Province of Tucumán there are considerable sugar
factories, some of them large ones. The cane is inferior
to that of Cuba and the West Indies; most of the available
land for its growing is taken up, and the sugar market
is often poor. None of the sugar is refined in the district
where it grows, there being only one refinery in Argentina
and that is at Rosario. The product is shipped to England
and France to be refined. It is doubtful if another
mill would pay, but another refinery and that in the city of
Tucumán might be profitable. There are no beet-sugar
factories, but much of the land, especially that in Entre
Rios and Corrientes, is adaptable for beet culture, so there
is no reason why an establishment of that kind could not
be made to pay.
</p>

<p>
Although Argentina has a great network of railways
running throughout the republic so that practically no
place of any importance is in lack of transportation facilities,
yet interurban street-car lines are nonexistent.
The only one in operation is that which runs between
Buenos Aires and Quilmes, a distance of fourteen miles.
One is being built to Tigre, twenty-two miles from Buenos
Aires, but is not yet in operation. There should be electric
lines between Buenos Aires and La Plata, Buenos Aires
and Rosario, either via San Nicolás or Pergamino, Buenos
Aires and Mercedes, Bahia Blanca and Puerto Belgrano,
Mendoza and San Rafael, Tucumán and Tafí Viejo, and
also a network of lines of which Tucumán should be the
center of the hub.
</p>

<p>
There are quite a few cigarette and a few cigar factories.
The cigarettes manufactured are vile, likewise the cigars.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_509' name='Page_509'>[509]</a></span>
This trade is in the hands of Turks, Spaniards, and Italians,
and the tobacco used is grown in Brazil. There are good
tobacco lands in the provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Corrientes,
and in the Territory of Misiones, but none is grown excepting
in gardens from which the owner makes cigars for his
own personal use. The price paid for cigars is exorbitant
and a good live factory well capitalized might pay.
Nobody smokes a pipe nor chews tobacco, therefore a
tobacco factory would be unsuitable.
</p>

<p>
There is no field in the newspaper or periodical line in all
South America. This and the publishing business is overdone.
Some towns of ten thousand people have four or
five daily papers. Every politician that can afford it is the
proprietor of his own newspaper, in whose columns he
attacks everybody who does not hold his own political
views. These newspapers often run foul of the government
and wind up by having their publications suppressed

Paraguay, on account of its small population and
scarcity of money, offers a much less diversified variety for
future enterprises than does Argentina. The leading
industry is the culture of yerba maté, and the exportation
of its leaves. This republic lies close to the tropics and is
covered with a dense vegetation. In the southeastern
part of the country in the neighborhood of the Alto
Paraná River, there grows in its native state the plant
yerba maté, from whose leaves from time immemorial the
Indians brewed a tea. The leaves are first dried, and then
steeped in a kettle or pot. Calabash gourds grow wild in
abundance. These are dried, the top is cut off, and the
insides scooped out. The hot tea is poured into these
gourds which every individual possesses, and the infusion
is sucked from them by means of straws and reeds, by the
poorer classes, and by bombillas by the upper and middle
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_510' name='Page_510'>[510]</a></span>
classes. A bombilla is a metal tube with a small covered
spoonlike head which is perforated with small holes.
This maté drinking habit, which is considered beneficial, is
indulged in universally by everybody in Paraguay, Argentina,
Uruguay, and southern Brazil. There are several
different varieties of yerba maté, and it has been found
that that which is cultivated is better than that which
grows wild. Hence there are enormous plantations for its
culture which are called yerbales. Large companies have
been formed for its production and exportation, that of
Domingo Barthe being the best known. His brand is
named Asuncion. The next best-known firm is the
Industriel Paraguaya. Both are capitalized heavily and
have their main offices in Asuncion and Villa Encarnacion
with branch offices throughout Argentina. Barthe is a
very wealthy man; he was formerly a French adventurer
who struck it rich through none too scrupulous means.
His latest trick was to sell a lot of his maté under the trademark
of the Industriel Paraguaya. This was done at
Rosario. He was tried there and found guilty. He was
sentenced to one year in jail and to pay a fine of two hundred
thousand dollars. Before they could get him, he got into
Paraguay where he is immune from the Argentine law.
He owns a fleet of steamers plying between Montevideo
and Asuncion which touch at Argentine ports. On these
he is safe since his steamship line is not incorporated
in Argentina. Nevertheless Barthe has helped advance
progress and industry in Argentina and this should not
have been overlooked when sentence was pronounced
upon him. At that time he was about to build a million-dollar
hotel at Posadas. Although what he did was unprincipled,
his sentence was twenty-fold too severe, and shows
plainly that the Argentine bloodsuckers are out to exploit
the foreigners for every cent they can get out of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_511' name='Page_511'>[511]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
There are in Paraguay boundless tracks of virgin soil
suitable for yerbales. It requires but little expense to
work them and there is an unlimited market for Paraguayan
tea. It is said that the Argentine army is going to
adopt yerba maté to be distributed among the soldiers for
their daily rations. This tea-drinking craze among the
natives is uncanny. To many of them it is life; the
foreigner, however, rarely acquires the habit, although he
partakes of it for the sake of sociability while in Paraguay.
</p>

<p>
Next in line among Paraguay's industries is the saladerias.
The whole country covered with a thick matting of
grasses is a paradise for cattle. Land is inexpensive, the
pasturage is better than in Argentina, and more stock can
be raised to the acre. Here and in Matto Grosso, a future
stock country, the grazing lands come down to the great
waterways, and although the river boats are of low draught
necessitating a rehandling at the seaport towns, canned
beef can be shipped direct from the saladerias in the stock
country.
</p>

<p>
Tannin is a more staple industry than in Argentina
although it is still in embryo. The writer had an opportunity
to engage in this manufacture, which he nearly
took up; in ordinary times it would have been all right, but
at this particular time there was a change in Paraguayan
politics and the manufacture of tannic acid was handicapped
by the European War. A Barcelona Spaniard,
Señor Andres Pujol, president of the Banco Constructador
del Paraguay and a friend of the writer, was held in high
esteem by the then dictator, Señor Eduardo Schaerer.
One of the large brick buildings owned by the Hernandarias
and Frias Brewery at Puerto Sajonia, on the outskirts
of Asuncion, was vacated in favor of a modern brewery
plant in the city. Its machinery could be used in the
manufacture of tannic acid and the plant could have been
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_512' name='Page_512'>[512]</a></span>
bought for a song. It was the idea of Señor Pujol for he
and myself to buy this building and erect, in connection
with it, a sawmill. We were to pay for quebracho logs
delivered at the plant from which we were to strip the
bark, from which we were to extract the tannin. At that
time Asuncion was having most of its new streets paved
with quebracho blocks. We were to give Señor Schaerer
stock in the company and in return he was to give us a
franchise to furnish the paving material which we would
manufacture by cutting up the logs at the sawmill. We
were also to be exempt from taxes for a number of years.
Soon after this Schaerer was succeeded in the presidency
by Dr. Manuel Franco, a native, and it was likely that he
would undo everything that Schaerer did, in which case
our franchise would not amount to a picayune. This combined
with the present prospects of no shipment of tannic
acid to foreign parts caused me not to inaugurate this
enterprise, which will still be open to anybody. The best
time to start this is soon after the election of a popular
president, because in the four years during which he will
hold office, there will be plenty of time in which to accumulate
a fortune.
</p>

<p>
The future manufacturing and commercial opportunities
in Chile is utterly different and far brighter than in
any other South American country. Chile has a decidedly
bright future and at the present time only lacks capital
to develop her resources. Business conditions are much
better; there is more snap to her people; there is less graft
and it is a cheaper country to live in. To this is added
the fact that the climate is good. Topographically and
geographically this republic can be divided into three
distinct zones. Beginning at its extreme north and
running down the coast one-third of its whole longitude
is the rainless zone. This is a vast forbidding desert,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_513' name='Page_513'>[513]</a></span>
interspersed at varying distances by a few oases. The
mountains begin at the ocean and gradually rise in steep
ranges until a maximum of twenty thousand feet is
attained in a hundred and fifty miles at the eastern
boundary which is the Argentine frontier. Twenty miles
back from the ocean are plateaus averaging from two
thousand to five thousand feet high which furnish most
of the world's nitrate supply. This nitrate is from two
to six feet underneath the surface of the soil and is supposed
to be the manure of birds that infested this region
in pre-glacial periods. From these fields is derived much
of the wealth of the country. Many of the older nitrate
fields have become exhausted, especially those farthest
north on the Iquique Pampa, but new ones are constantly
being opened up to the south of the old workings and from
them is due the importance of Antofagasta. It was to
acquire these nitrate deposits that Chile declared war upon
Bolivia and Peru in 1879 which caused them to change
hands. It is a blessing to that part of the country that it
never rains, because if it did, the nitrate deposits would be
washed away. This zone is hot.
</p>

<p>
The second zone is that which begins immediately south
of the rainless one and which extends another third of the
length of the country down the coast. It consists of a
coast range of mountains timbered with conifers and small
hardwood trees, the mountain peaks rarely rising above
three thousand feet in altitude. Beyond them is the
great longitudinal valley from thirty to fifty miles in
width. Here are situated most of the towns and two
thirds of the country's population. This is the granary
of the republic, and it is here that are located the
great vineyards, the fruit farms, and the small manufacturing
industries. This zone has a sufficiency of
annual precipitation but climatically is divided into two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_514' name='Page_514'>[514]</a></span>
seasons, the dry and the rainy one. During the winter
months from May to October there are frequent rains
while the rest of the year it seldom rains, although
showers are likely to occur at any time, these being of more
frequent prevalence the farther south one goes.
</p>

<p>
The remaining zone which reaches the remaining distance
of the coast line as far as Cape Horn is an archipelago
and a narrow strip of land extending inland about fifty
miles to the Argentine frontier. This district is a mountainous
mass, indented by many bays and fiords, well
timbered, but so steep are the mountains that come down
to the water's edge that there are no towns and but few
places where habitations can be built. A great part of
this region is unexplored. It undoubtedly is rich in mineral
deposits but its inaccessibility has kept it from being
developed. The annual rainfall is great but this diminishes
towards the southern apex. In winter there are
heavy snowfalls, while the tops of the mountains possess
innumerable glaciers.
</p>

<p>
Chile is rich in minerals. Some of its mines have been
worked ever since the Spanish conquest and new fields are
constantly being opened. In the arid north copper is
found behind Gatico and at Chuquicamata, the Guggenheim
interests being at the latter place. There are copper
mines in the provinces of Atacama, and Coquimbo, and
at the headwaters of the Cauquenes River in the Province
of Colchagua is the large productive mine of the Braden
Copper Company. There are iron mines at La Higuera
in the Province of Coquimbo and coal mines at Lota, in the
Province of Concepcion. Silver and gold is found throughout
the whole republic in paying quantities. Next to
nitrate and minerals, vineyards play the most important
part. From the Province of Aconcagua southward 250
miles, grapes play a great rôle, yet but little wine is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_515' name='Page_515'>[515]</a></span>
exported. The southern provinces and the Central Valley
produce an abundance of wheat, rye, and barley, but owing
to an inadequate market, it is a gamble whether the farmer
will lose or make a profit on his crops.
</p>

<p>
What Chile needs more than capital is immigration.
Her increase in population has been small, likewise her
immigration. The European immigrant lands at Buenos
Aires and seeks employment in Argentina, while if he
crossed the Andes into Chile, he would find a land where
he could make a better living for himself and buy some of
the most fertile land in this universe for a cheap price.
Southern Chile has a large population of German descent
who have done remarkably well, but the great number of
Spaniards and Italians who yearly immigrate to the republics
of South America's eastern littoral are here conspicuous
by their absence.
</p>

<p>
In manufactures, the breweries are Chile's largest
industry. There is a brewery trust in Chile, like in
Argentina, but it is nowhere near so strong nor so well
capitalized. It consists of La Calera Brewery at La
Calera, the Valdivia Breweries Company at Valdivia, the
Andres Ebner Brewery at Santiago, the Floto Brewery at
La Serena and the Limache-Cousiño Brewery at Limache,
which is the largest in Chile. A fact which shows that
the trust is not strong is that all the independent breweries
have done well. Aubel's Brewery at Osorno, and Keller's
Breweries at Concepcion and Talca are large ones. There
are many small breweries such as Petersen's at Punta
Arenas, Julius Jenson's at Chillán, and Horstmann's
at Santiago. Much beer is drunk in Chile, and there is
plenty of grain, so after the war there will be an excellent
opportunity of starting a brewery. The only drawback
has been the supply of malt and hops which comes from
foreign countries and which the brewers have been unable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_516' name='Page_516'>[516]</a></span>
to procure in sufficient quantities in recent years owing
to the freight shortage.
</p>

<p>
Santiago is a city of over four hundred thousand inhabitants
yet only has two breweries, that of Ebner which
belongs to the trust and that of Horstmann which does
not. Horstmann before the war got a supply of hops large
enough to last him six years if his brewery ran at its full
capacity. He is an old man who has amassed all the
money he wants, and his heirs have no inclination to continue
the business. In 1917 he could have been bought
out at a very reasonable price and I believe the same holds
true to-day. His business has been a family trade and his
beer is said to be the best in Chile. Since there is small
likelihood of Chile ever going prohibition, here is a chance
for somebody. Valparaiso has no brewery on account
of its water being too hard. I have no doubt but that a
brewery at either Chillán, which has only one small
brewery, or at Curicó which has no brewery, would pay.
Temuco, Los Angeles, San Fernando, and Linares could
support breweries. In northern Chile there are no breweries
excepting one at La Serena, yet either Antofagasta or
Iquique would be ideal spots for one. The water in these
cities has to be piped in from a distance of 150 miles, yet
since there is sufficient to supply other establishments
there would be enough to supply breweries. Copiapó
is likewise well situated for a brewery. It could be made
the central distributing point for other towns such as
Antofagasta, Taltal, Chañaral, Vallenar, and Huasco.
The output could be shipped to its seaport Caldera, and
thence along the coast to the other towns in case of a
shortage of freight cars. In Chile as in the United States
the breweries buy saloon licenses to put into business
men who handle only their goods, but unlike in the United
States, saloons play no part in politics, and with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_517' name='Page_517'>[517]</a></span>
exception of the sailors' dives in the seaports they are run
in strict accordance with the law. The violations that I
have mentioned in this book occurred in Antofagasta
which has the reputation of being a notoriously tough town.
</p>

<p>
A business with a future and which could be made
profitable is an enamel works and tin-ware factory. In
all South America, business signs, doctors' signs, street
names, and house numbers are of enamelled tin. Most
of the kitchen ware, bathtubs, and chamber sets are of the
same article. There is an enamel ware works at Valparaiso
and another one at Santiago. The latter is the
Esmaltadera Chilena, managed by Don Federigo Reddoehl.
This would be a paying proposition but so far lacks
capital. The heaviest interest is owned by a senator
named Charme, but the other stockholders could be
bought out at par. Chile is dependent upon the United
States for its sheet-iron and tin supply; the war has put a
damper on this, but as soon as shipments can be renewed,
there is no reason why an enterprise of this kind would
not be a good investment.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately Chile's timber is hardwood, so lumber
mills would not pay. It is dependent on its lumber for
building purposes from the United States. Although
there is much hardwood, the floors are tile or cement,
which is much cheaper there than oak or maple, and since
the ordinary pocket-book cannot afford to pay the price
of the latter, a hardwood flooring plant would be negative.
</p>

<p>
In the south there are plenty of small flour mills but
there are but few in the Central Valley. Since much grain
goes to waste and since flour is in demand, more of these
small mills could be started, but none of the cities near to
the grain supply are large enough to warrant large mills.
</p>

<p>
Chile is not a stock country. Cattle are dear, likewise
the hides. Therefore a shoe factory would not pay.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_518' name='Page_518'>[518]</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The railroads of the Central Valley are owned by the
state and do not pay on account of it. The personnel is
large and is made up entirely of political henchmen of the
senators and congressmen. The government realizes this
and there has been talk of renting the lines or selling them
to private companies. This would be good sense. This
Central Valley is crossed lengthwise by one main trunk-line
touching at the important towns. From these at
right angles run branch lines to places of minor importance.
Yet so thickly settled is this valley, and so productive
is it, that another parallel line from Santiago to
Concepcion, touching points not on the government railway,
could possibly be made to pay a profit. From Talca
it could run southwestward through San Javier, and
Cauquenes crossing the coast range between Quirihue and
Coelemu at no perceptibly steep grade, opening up a new
country, and saving a distance of seventy-five miles
between the terminals. The country is mostly level and
there would be no difficult engineering feats. The railroad
from Santiago to Valparaiso is a roundabout one and crosses
the steep mountain pass of Tiltil. For years it has been
talked of to shorten this line making it go through Casa
Blanca, but the government has had no money for expenditures
of such a sort. I have no doubt but that it would
give a private company a concession if it meant business.
An interurban electric line between these two large cities
might pay. It would be eighty-five miles long and would
also open up a new country.
</p>

<p>
Chile is in need of many first-class modern hotels built
on the North American style, but not cramped for room
like in the United States, and with the guests' rooms large
enough for comfort. Santiago, Valparaiso, and Concepcion
have good hotels, but in the other cities they are poor.
It would not pay a North American to build a hotel south
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_519' name='Page_519'>[519]</a></span>
of Concepcion because in that region German influence
predominates, and in many places the German population
outnumbers that of the native. For years to come after
the war the North American would be boycotted there.
Antofagasta opens an excellent field in the hotel line.
There are four hotels there where it is possible to sleep
and eat, but they fall much below the standard for such a
busy port. The trade is evenly divided between them,
but an up-to-date hostelry could easily shift that to themselves.
Arica is badly off in the hotel line. This is the
port of La Paz, Bolivia, and traveling men to and from
that city are often obliged to put in a few days in this most
northern seaport of Chile while waiting for their steamer.
Coquimbo, Talca, and Chillán need modern hotels, as
well as Los Andes. The latter town which has a population
of 8097 is important because it is the jumping-off
place for Argentina. The narrow-gauge railroad
from there to Mendoza is of such a nature that the
trip has to be made in daylight on account of curves,
bridges, and steep gradients which would be dangerous
to traverse at night. Passengers en route for Argentina
leave Santiago and Valparaiso in the evening arriving at
Los Andes at night where they stop over, and continue
the next morning. The train coming from Argentina
arrives at Los Andes at night and as it is sometimes late,
passengers prefer to stop over there, continuing to Santiago
in the morning, rather than to change trains and
arrive at Santiago at an unseemly hour. The only hotel
fit to stop at in Los Andes is the poor one owned by
the Transandine Railway, and it is nearly always overcrowded.
It is a flimsy frame structure, dirty, and with
poor service. It is some distance from the main part of
the city, but another hotel built in its neighborhood would
catch all the transient trade, because most of it focuses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_520' name='Page_520'>[520]</a></span>
there instead of in the town. Rancagua has a floating
population comprised of the mining element from the
Braden Copper Company. Many of these are North
Americans and Canadians, and every day some of them
are obliged to stop overnight at Rancagua to get a train
out the following day. Also Rancagua is the station for
the Baths of Cauquenes to which there is constant journeying
to and fro during the summer season. The city has a
population of 10,380 irrespective of transient trade with
no hotel fit to stop at.
